Many such systems exhibit characteristic common properties despite dramatic differences in key parameters such as temperature, density, field strength and others. The existence of universal regimes, where even quantitative agreements between seemingly disparate physical systems can be observed, drives a remarkable convergence of research activities across traditional lines of specialisation.\n\nThe International Conference on Quantum Systems in Extreme Conditions (QSEC2019), September 23-27, brings together experimental and theoretical researchers working on topics that are particularly driven by such cross-disciplinary developments, in particular:\n\nFar from equilibrium dynamics and thermalisation of quantum systems\n\nQuantum systems with strong fields\n\nPhase structure of systems in extreme conditions\n\nKeynote talks will provide overviews about quantum systems in extreme conditions in heavy ion collisions, precision spectroscopy in highly charged ions, and ultracold quantum gases. Contributed talks are dedicated to recent progress in these systems. Abundant discussion time and two poster sessions are foreseen for the vital interactions between experimental and theoretical physicists working in the different areas.\n\n	2

France	 IN2P3 / CEA	This series of workshops, started 20 years ago, aims  to bring together theorists and experimentalists working on the phenomenology of  TeV colliders with an emphasis on the physics at the LHC. The highlight of the 2019 Les Houches Edition is to take full advantage of the data that has been collected at the LHC so far and prepare for the future runs. With this much data, following the discovery of a Higgs-like particle, one aim of this workshop is how to best sharpen our tools and techniques in order to reconstruct the profile of this particle and possibly uncover New Physics. An equally important aim is to reassess some of the still open fundamental questions in the light of this discovery and investigate which kind of New Physics such a particle may be hinting at. The importance of precision measurements on the one hand and precision calculations and simulation on the other hand is central. In the light of the LHC results, a reflection on the strategy in HEP and prospects from future facilities (at high and low energy) should be conducted. In view of the above considerations, the Workshop will devote particular attention to:\n\n(i) Higgs physics, and how it shapes our view on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking; (ii) related searches for New Physics and (iii) progress in new techniques for the calculations and simulation of Standard Model processes.\n\nThe Workshop will address issues such as how to best exploit these data as well as how to prepare for future LHC data, and what is most desirable in LHC upgrades. These activities will be conducted in close connection with the development and improvements of related theory tools, in particular of Monte-Carlo event generators. The role of machine learning and artificial intelligence will be part of these new development.\n\nThe Workshop runs over one year, including two meetings in Les Houches in the month of June, and exchanges and collaborations before and after the meetings. The meetings in Les Houches will consist of two sessions:\n\n* Session I: 10-19 June 2019 with emphasis on SM-related issues.\n\n* Session II: 19-28 June 2019  with emphasis on New-Physics searches\n\n	2

889	ESHEP2019: European School of High-Energy Physics , 4-17 Sep 2019, Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation)	ESHEP2019	2019-09-04	2019-09-09	physics	Entered into the database. This conference is classified as school.		Russian Federation	 Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation)	Academic Programme:\n\nThere will be about 33 lectures, each lasting about 90 minutes including time for questions. These will be complemented by parallel group discussion sessions most afternoons. There will be an evening poster session during which all students are invited to present their research work. In addition, there will be group project work based on an outreach theme. The timetable will be available soon. The scientific programme can be found here.\n\nWho can apply?\n\nThe European School is targeted particularly at students in experimental HEP who are in the final years of work towards their PhDs. Other schools, such as the CERN-FNAL Hadron Collider School may provide more appropriate training for young postdocs in experimental HEP, PhD students who have already attended the European School, and senior PhD students in HEP phenomenology. It should be noted that some pre-knowledge of the subjects is necessary in order to be able to profit fully from the lecture courses.\n\nDemand for attendance at the European Schools exceeds the number of available places, so a competitive selection is made. Preference is given to students who have connections with CERN and JINR member states either because of their nationality, or because of their institutional affiliation, or because they are involved in an experimental programme at a laboratory located in one of the member states. Nevertheless, applications from other geographical areas will be considered. One or two students from developing countries could be considered for financial support.\n\n	2

Spain	 Puerto de la Cruz (Spain)	Along with the direct searches of new particles at the LHC, low-energy phenomenology offers many complementary ways to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. The low-energy searches, however, are often hindered by the insufficiently precise knowledge of hadronic contributions. The last decade has witnessed tremendous progress towards ab-initio and model-independent determinations of these contributions. The purpose of this meeting is to cross-examine the empirical and theoretical progress in this field and the implications in beyond-the-SM physics.\n\nThe 2nd Edition of Hadronic Contributions to New Physics searches (HC2NP 2019) wil take place in Puerto de la Cruz (Tenerife) from September 23 to 28 and  will focus on the following  SUBTOPICS:\n\nMuon and electron g-2 : To review theoretical progress on the predictions in light of the upcoming measurement of the Muon g-2 FNAL experiment. To review also BSM in the context of a broader paradigm of LFUV or new experimental proposals.\n\nLong-distance contributions to meson FCNCs: Long-distance contributions in B, K decays and their mixing are crucial to interpret the flavor anomalies. We aim at reviewing relevant lattice and phenomenological calculations, including the status of electromagnetic corrections, and the BSM implications of this program.\n\nBaryon structure: Cross-examine lattice and phenomenological determinations of nucleon and nuclear structure and their interplay with direct searches of DM, searches of New Physics or neutrino experiments. Specific applications include BSM ideas related to the neutron lifetime,  radiative corrections to nuclear β decays and the proton-charge radius puzzle.\n\n	2

33	Easing the Control System Application Development for CMS Detector Control System with Automatic Production Environment Reproduction.	The Detector Control System (DCS) is one of the main pieces involved in the operation of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC. The system is built using WinCC Open Architecture (WinCC OA) and the Joint Controls Project (JCOP) framework which was developed on top of WinCC at CERN. Following the JCOP paradigm, CMS has developed its own framework which is structured as a collection of more than 200 individual installable components each providing a different feature. Everyone of the systems that the CMS DCS consists of is created by installing a different set of these components. By automating this process, we are able to quickly and efficiently create new systems in production or recreate problematic ones, but also, to create development environments that are identical to the production ones. This latter one results in smoother development and integration processes, as the new/reworked components are developed and tested in production-like environments. Moreover, it allows the central DCS support team to easily reproduce systems that the users/developers report as being problematic, reducing the response time for bug fixing and improving the support quality.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		796	2

The CMS ECAL Detector Control System (DCS) and the CMS ECAL Safety System (ESS) have supported the detector operations and ensured the detector's integrity since the CMS commissioning phase, more than 10 years ago. Over this long period, several changes to both systems were necessary to keep them in-line with current hardware technologies and the evolution of software platforms. The acquired experience of long-term running of both systems led to the need of major modifications to the original design and implementation methods. Such interventions to either systems, which require mid- to long-term validation, result in a considerable amount of downtime and therefore can only be performed during long LHC shutdown periods. This paper discusses the software and hardware upgrades to be carried out during the LHC Long Shutdown 2 (LS2), with emphasis on the evaluation of design choices concerning custom and standard industrial hardware.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		796	2

36	The upgrade and re-validation of the Compact Muon Solenoid Electromagnetic Calorimeter Control and Safety Systems during the second Long Shutdown of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN	The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is one of the sub-detectors of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), a general-purpose particle detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The CMS ECAL Detector Control System (DCS) and the CMS ECAL Safety System (ESS) have supported the detector operations and ensured the detector's integrity since the CMS commissioning phase, more than 10 years ago. Over this long period, several changes to both systems were necessary to correct issues, extend functionality and keep them in-line with current hardware technologies and the evolution of software platforms. Due to the constraints imposed on significant changes to a running system, major hardware and software upgrades were therefore deferred to the second LHC Long Shutdown (LS2). This paper presents the architectures of the CMS ECAL control and safety systems, discusses the ongoing and planned upgrades, details implementation processes and validation methods and highlights the expectations for the post-LS2 systems.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
37	Silicon sensors for the HGCal upgrade: challenges, sensor design & electrical characterization	The CMS detector will undergo significant improvements to face the 10-fold increase in luminosity of LHC, the so-called High-Luminosity LHC, scheduled to start in 2026. This will include a completely new calorimeter in the CMS endcap regions which should be able to withstand fluences of up to 10^16 n_{eq}/cm^2. The new High Granularity Calorimeter will have unprecedented transverse and longitudinal segmentation that will facilitate the particle-flow approach to reconstruct electromagnetic and hadronic particle showers and their energies. In regions of low radiation, HGCal will be equipped with small plastic scintillator tiles as active material coupled to silicon photomultipliers, whilst in the higher radiation zone silicon was chosen due to its radiation hardness. The silicon sensors will be of hexagonal shape, with three nominal thicknesses of 120 um, 200 um and 300 um, optimized for regions of different radiation levels. They will be segmented into several hundred cells with hexagonal shape of 0.5 to 1 cm^2 in size, each of which is read out individually. Currently, a comprehensive campaign is in progress to converge on optimal sensor design choices and parameters, such as bulk doping, layouts and production methods. In this talk, results from full electrical sensor characterization are presented for different sensors, together with first results from an irradiation campaign of large-area silicon sensors. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		801	2

38	Exploiting CRIC to streamline the configuration management of glideinWMS factories for CMS support	GlideinWMS is a workload management and provisioning system that allows sharing computing resources distributed over independent sites. Based on the requests made by glideinWMS Frontends, a dynamically sized pool of resources is created by glideinWMS pilot Factories via pilot job submission to resource sites' computing elements. More than 400 computing elements (CE) are currently serving more than 10 virtual organizations through glideinWMS, with CMS being the biggest user with 230 CEs. The complex configurations of the parameters definining resource requests, as submitted to those CEs,  have been historically managed by manually editing a set of different xml files. New possibilities arise with CMS adopting the Computing Resource Information Catalogue (CRIC), an information system that collects, aggregates, stores, and exposes, among other things, computing resource data coming from various data providers. The talk will describe the challenges faced when CMS started to use CRIC to automatically generate the glideinWMS factory configurations. The architecture of the prototype, and the ancillary tools developed to ease this transition, will be discussed. Finally, future plans and milestones will be outlined.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
39	Versatile systems for characterization of large-area silicon pad sensors	High granularity calorimeters with silicon pad sensors as active material are proposed for the CMS endcap calorimeter upgrade as well as for the electromagnetic calorimeters at CLIC and ILC. The silicon sensors in such experiments are foreseen to cover a very large area of O(1000m^2 ). They are typically produced from 6- or 8-inch wafers and consist of a few hundred smaller cells, each with an area of O(0.1 to 1cm^2 ). Currently the CMS forward calorimeter upgrade is in prototyping phase with the aim of choosing the final sensor design. Flexible systems are needed for quick sensor characterizationas close as possible to operation conditions, for testing of prototypesand for quality control during mass production. The ARRAY system consists of an active switching matrix PCB with 512 input channels and a passive probe card specific for each sensor layout.The probe card makes contact with each individual pad through spring-loaded pins. ARRAY is designed to measure the leakage current and capacitance per-cell for different bias voltages, keeping the entire sensor area under bias. The Hexaboard probe card follows a similar principle: readout electronics foreseen to be used in the final detector is mounted on a PCB which makes contact with the sensor through spring-loaded pins. Its main goal is to perform noise and charge collection efficiency measurements with irradiated sensors without the need for module assembly.In this talk, measurements performed on different CMS prototype silicon sensors using the ARRAY and Hexaboardsystems are presented as well as a comparison with alternative multi-needle setups. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		801	2

44	Effect of deformation due to stretching of the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) Foil	The Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) was first introduced by Fabio Sauli in 1997, which is\r\na thin layer of an insulating polymer, coated on both sides with copper and chemically\r\nperforated with a high density of microscopic holes. The GEM detectors, which are built\r\nusing GEM foils, have been utilized for various applications due to their excellent spatial\r\nresolution, high rate capabilities and flexibility in design. CMS GEM collaboration is\r\nplanning to install large-area triple GEM detectors in forward region of CMS muon endcaps.\r\nDuring the assembly of these detectors, the GEM foils are manually stretched to\r\nmaintain the required gap configuration throughout the detector area. This stretching\r\nprocedure can introduce local variation in the size or the shape of the perforated holes in\r\nGEM foil which can further vary the operational characteristics of the foil as well as the\r\ndetector. Therefore, the distribution and size of the holes over a GEM foil should be\r\nuniform to achieve uniform functionality of the detector over the active surface. We can\r\nprevent the deformation of the perforated holes by optimizing the stretching force which is\r\nused during the assembly. We also present the effect on the gain of the detector due to\r\nover stretching of the foil leading to deformation of the holes.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2
45	Channel Loss Investigation in VFAT3 Hybrids for CMS GEM Detectors   	VFAT3 is a 128-channel charge sensitive amplifier chip designed for the readout of GEM detectors in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN. High Voltage Discharges have been observed in the large (1 m long) CMS GEM detectors, which damaged the input channels of the chip despite the built-in internal protection diodes for channel protection. This paper presents preliminary results for three different versions of the hybrids designed to protect the VFAT3 from GEM discharges. First, with the base-line hybrid called V2, which has no external protection we produced controlled discharges to observe the protection capabilities of the built-in diodes. The baseline hybrid showed channel loss at 28uJ of energy. We then developed two new versions of hybrids, one with external series resistors, called V3 and another with external protection diodes, called V4. The V3 also showed slight increase in the cross talk and ENC due to coupling between neighbouring channels. The hybrid designs and their performance will be discussed in this contribution.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2

The detectors will have to withstand 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence of up to 2 × 10^16 cm^2 at 2.8 cm distance from the beam axis.

51	Characteristics and Performance of RD53A Readout Chip Equipped with Small-pixel Silicon Sensors	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will undergo a luminosity upgrade. The upgrade, which has started in summer 2018, aims to increase the instantanous luminosity of the machine by a factor of ten to 10^35 cm^-2s^-1, hence boosting the physics potential of its experiments.\r\nThe increased luminosity leads to a higher rate of proton-proton interactions, in the order of 200 events per bunch crossing, and a larger deposited dose in the detectors. Therefore, the detectors at HL-LHC should be able to cope with the new conditions.\r\nThe CMS experiment will upgrade many of its sub-detectors [1]. An extensive R&D programme is currently in progress for the so called Phase-2 upgrade of the CMS Inner Tracker (IT). A large variety of new small-pixel sensor designs are tested in order to identify the designs, which meet the requirements of the HL-LHC.\r\nThe small-pixel sensors are read out by the new RD53A readout chip [2] which has been developed by the RD53 collaboration, a joint effort of the CMS and ATLAS experiments. The first version of this chip has been produced and is employed in the sensor R&D programme. This programme also allows the RD53A user community to evaluate and characterise the performance of the readout chip when equipped with various sensors designs.\r\nIn this presentation, we will report on the studies performed on the RD53A chip within the CMS pixel upgrade R&D programme. The results of RD53A energy calibration using X-ray fluorescence before and after irradiation will be presented. Multiple RD53A modules with various sensor designs have been tested with particle beams. The tuning procedure for chip operation parameters and performance of RD53A and a comparison of the results obtained from different sensor designs will be presented. These results include lowest achievable threshold, signal to noise ratio, cross-talk and efficiency at various irradiation fluences.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2
52	Upgrade of the CMS Muon Spectrometer in the forward region with the Triple-GEM technology 	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be upgraded in several phases to significantly expand its physics program. After the long shutdown of 2019 and 2020 (LS2) the accelerator luminosity will be increased to 2 − 3 * 10^34cm−2s−1 exceeding the design value of 1 * 10^34cm−2s−1 allowing the CMS experiment to collect approximately 100 fb−1/year. A subsequent upgrade in 2022-23 will increase the luminosity up to 5 * 10^34cm−2s−1. The CMS muon system must be able to sustain a physics program after the LS2 shutdown that maintains sensitivity to electroweak scale physics and for TeV scale searches similar to what was achieved up to now. To cope with the corresponding increase in background rates and trigger requirements the installation of additional sets of muon detectors, referred to as GE1/1, GE2/1 and ME0 that use Triple-GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) technology has been planned. The installation and commissioning of the GE1/1 chambers is starting now and will continue through 2019 and 2020, while the GE2/1 and ME0 detectors are expected to be installed after 2022. In this contribution we present an overview of the muon spectrometer upgrade using the Triple-GEM technology, the ongoing GE1/1 chambers production with the first results of the quality assurance tests performed in a large test bench that can host up to 30 GE1/1 chambers and where each GE1/1 detector is recording cosmic muons during several weeks before being installed in CMS. We will also present the status of the detector and electronics designs as well as the technical solutions adopted for the foreseen GE2/1 and ME0 upgrade, with a summary of the R&D activities ongoing. Namely we will present recent results obtained with a first GE2/1 chamber equipped with the new front-end electronics prototype.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2
53	Precision Timing with LYSO:Ce Crystals & SiPM Sensors for the CMS MTD Barrel Timing Layer	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is undergoing an extensive Phase II upgrade program to prepare for the challenging conditions of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In particular, a new timing detector will measure minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with a time resolution of ~30-40 ps and hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |η|=3. The precision time information from this MIP Timing Detector (MTD) will reduce the effects of the high levels of pile-up expected at the HL-LHC and will bring new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. The central Barrel Timing Layer (BTL) will be based on LYSO:Ce crystals read out with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The BTL will use elongated crystal bars, with double-sided read out, with a SiPM on each end of the crystal, in order to maximize detector performance within the constraints of space, cost, and channel count. This unusual geometry enables the instrumentation of large surfaces while minimizing the active area of the photodetectors, and thus noise and power consumption. We will present an overview of the MTD BTL design and will detail the extensive R&D studies carried out to optimize the MTD BTL crystal-based technology and test beam results in which the goal of 30 ps timing resolution has been achieved. We will also present progress in the development of the dedicated readout electronics for the BTL.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2

55	Status of the CMS ECAL phase 2 upgrade for high precision timing and energy measurements	The upgrade of the barrel portion of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment (CMS) for the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) will extend the capabilities of the detector in multiple ways to cope with the unprecedented number of pile-up events (up to 200 simultaneous proton-proton collisions) and a challenging increase in data rates. The lead tungstate crystals and avalanche photodiode detectors of the current ECAL barrel detector will remain, while the entire readout electronics will be replaced. The upgraded detector will have an 25 fold improved readout granularity and the sampling rate will increase 4 fold. We will report on recent progress on the front-end electronics, which includes a dual gain trans-impedance amplifier in a 130nm CMOS and an ASIC providing two 160 MHz ADC channels, gain selection, and data compression, in 65nm CMOS technology. To support the roughly 100 fold increase in data rates, the back-end electronics are being upgraded to support the Level-1 trigger latency increase from about 4 µs to a maximum of 12.5 µs and the trigger rate increase to an average of 750 kHz. We will report on a demonstrator platform, the Barrel Calorimeter Processor demonstrator (BCPd), implemented in an AdvancedTCA (ATCA) blade capable of supporting 56 input and output fibers, 16 Gbps each, serving as the nexus between the detector front-end electronics, the trigger sub-system and the DAQ sub-system. In addition, the upgraded detector will have the capability to provide precision timing measurements, of the order of 30 ps for photons and electrons above 10 GeV which will significantly improve the CMS physics performance under the expected pile-up conditions. The status of the ongoing R&D activities for the ECAL barrel upgrade will be presented, together with the latest performance tests with prototypes, and the project status, including the technically and logistically challenging tasks of the ECAL Phase upgrade.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2
56	First results of CIC data aggregation ASIC for the future CMS Tracker	The Concentrator Integrated Circuit (CIC) ASIC is a front-end chip for both Pixel-Strip (PS) and Strip-Strip (2S) modules of the future Phase-2 CMS Outer Tracker upgrade at  the High-Luminosity  LHC  (HL-LHC). It  collects  the  digital  data  coming  from  eight  upstream  front-end chips  (either  MPAs  or  CBCs,  depending  on  the  module  type), formats the signal in data packets containing the trigger information from eight bunch crossings  and  the  raw  data  from  events passing  the  first  trigger  level,  and  finally transmits  them  to  the  LpGBT  unit. A  first  prototype  in  a  65nm  CMOS technology integrating  all functionalities  for  system  level  operation,  CIC1,  has  been  tested  in early 2019. The design and its implementation, along with test results, are presented. Current development of the final CIC version will also be described.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2

58	Studies and validation of a CMS Drift Tube trigger algorithm for HL-LHC 	The electronics of the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) DT (Drift Tubes) chambers will need to be replaced for the HL-LHC (High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider) operation due to the increase of occupancy and trigger rates in the detector, which cannot be sustained by present system. A new system is being designed that will forward asynchronously the totality of the chambers signals to the control room, at full resolution. A new backend system will be in charge of building the trigger primitives of each chamber out of this asynchronous information, aiming at achieving resolutions comparable to the ones that the offline High Level Trigger can obtain nowadays. In this way, the new system will provide improved functionality with respect to present system, allowing to improve the resilience to potential aging situations.\r\nAn algorithm has been designed for this new backend system following a simplified, hardware-oriented procedure optimizing the FPGA resources. The performance of this algorithm has been validated through different methods: from a software emulation approach to hardware implementation tests. The performance obtained is very good, with optimal timing and position resolutions, close to the ultimate performance of the DT chamber system. \r\nOne important validation step has included the implementation of this algorithm in a prototype chain of the HL-LHC electronics, which has been operated with real DT chambers under cosmic data taking campaigns. The new trigger primitive generation has been implemented in spare uTCA boards from present DT system which host Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGAs. The performance of this prototyping system has been verified and will be presented in this contribution, showing the goodness of the design for the expected functionality during HL-LHC. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2

61	Results from the Compact Muon Solenoid GE1/1 Slice Test and Status of the Installation and Commissioning of the GE1/1 Detectors	Abstract— The GE1/1 system is the newest subdetector to be\r\nadded to the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) endcap muon\r\nsystem. It consists of a series of 144 triple-GEM (gas electron\r\nmultiplier) detectors, installed as 36 two-detector\r\n“superchambers” in each endcap. Due to the existing mechanical\r\nrestrictions of CMS, these are further broken down into 18 short\r\n(1.61 < |η| < 2.18) and 18 long (1.55 < |η| < 2.18) superchambers in\r\neach endcap. These detectors are placed in front of the already existing\r\nCSCs (cathode strip chambers) and will interface with\r\nthem, allowing for added redundancy in a difficult η region,\r\nbetter tracking in a high rate environment, and measurement of\r\nthe bending angle at the trigger level to decrease the number of\r\nmismeasured muons. During the 2017-2018 run, ten “slice test”\r\ndetectors were installed in order to serve as a proof of concept\r\nand to act as a trial run for the full system. Data was recorded\r\nduring these runs using both cosmic ray muons and LHC\r\ncollisions. During this time, a loss of VFAT2 channels was\r\nobserved, with two detectors exhibiting rapidly-increasing\r\nchannel loss beginning mid-2018. Investigations as to the cause of\r\nthis loss were launched, and the lessons learned from these\r\ninvestigations allowed for the improvement of the design of the\r\nVFAT3 readout chip in time for the production and installation\r\nof the final GE1/1 detectors. In this contribution, we will present\r\nthe status of the production, installation, and commissioning of\r\nthe GE1/1 detectors and on the lessons learned throughout the\r\nprocess.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2

63	 Study and Improvement of the Planarity of GEM Detectors for CMS 	The CMS GEM Collaboration has developed a specific design of large triple-GEM detectors for the upgrade of the CMS muon end-caps. In particular, a new technique was introduced to mechanically stretch the GEM foils without using spacer grids or glue inside the gas volume. However, this technique may introduce irregularities in the planarity of the detectors which can potentially affect the uniformity and the operation of the chambers. Therefore, the collaboration has established a set of tests and quality controls in order to quantify these irregularities and mitigate their impact on detector performance. Additionally, new solutions and design upgrades have been implemented to prevent such effects in future CMS GEM upgrade projects.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2
64	Advanced Aging Study of Triple-GEM Detectors 	A novel study is proposed and performed to better understand aging in contaminated gas mixtures in an environment of heavily ionizing particles. A 10×10 cm^2 triple-GEM prototype with 3/1/2/1 mm gap configuration is studied in the CMS - GEM QA/QC lab. The aims are to look for previously unseen aging issues related to the outgassing of some materials and to determine if particles with different specific ionization may induce aging effects which were absent in previous studies using X-rays and γ-rays. The prototype is irradiated in two different regions at the same time with two types of sources: a 5.5 MeV alpha emitter (241Am) and 5.9 keV X-ray source (55Fe) to look for different behaviours in the two areas. Hydrocarbons and silicon-based molecules are released inside the gas volume as contaminants. This simulates the pollutants released in a clean mixture during many years of normal detector operation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2
65	Study of the Effects of Radiation at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility on the CMS Drift Tubes Muon Detector for the HL-LHC	The CMS drift tubes (DT) muon detector, built for standing up the LHC expected integrated and instantaneous luminosities, will be used also in the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) at a 5 times larger instantaneous luminosity and, consequently, much higher levels of radiation, reaching about 10 times the LHC integrated luminosity. Initial irradiation tests of a spare DT chamber at the CERN gamma irradiation facility (GIF++), at large (~O(100)) acceleration factor, showed aging effects resulting in a degradation of the DT cell performance [1]; however, full CMS simulations have shown almost no impact in the muon reconstruction efficiency over the full barrel acceptance and for the full integrated luminosity. A second spare DT chamber was moved inside the GIF++ bunker in October 2017. The chamber was being irradiated at lower acceleration factors, and only 2 out of the 12 layers of the chamber are switched at working voltage when the radioactive source is active, being the other layers in standby. In this way the other non-aged layers are used as reference and as a precise and unbiased telescope of muon tracks for the efficiency computation of the aged layers of the chamber, when set at working voltage for measurements. An integrated dose equivalent to two times the expected integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC run has been absorbed by this second spare DT chamber and the final impact on the muon reconstruction efficiency is under study. Direct inspection of some extracted aged anode wires presented a melted resistive deposition of materials. Investigation on the outgassing of cell materials and of the gas components used at the GIF++ are underway. Strategies to mitigate the aging effects are also being developed. From the long irradiation measurements of the second spare DT chamber, the effects of radiation in the performance of the DTs expected during the HL-LHC run will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2
66	CMS Phase II Upgrade with GEM Detectors	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be upgraded in several phases that will allow significant expansion of its physics program. The final luminosity of the accelerator is expected to exceed 5 × 1034cm−2s−1, five times more the original design value. The CMS muon system must be able to sustain a physics program after the increase of luminosity and maintain sensitivity for electroweak physics for TeV scale searches similar to what was achieved up to now. To cope with the corresponding increase in background rates and trigger requirements, the installation of additional sets of muon detectors based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) technology, referred to as GE1/1, GE2/1 and ME0, has been planned. The installation and commissioning of the GE1/1 chambers is scheduled by 2019/20, while the GE2/1 and ME0 detectors are expected to be installed between 2022 and 2024. We present an overview of the Muon Spectrometer upgrade using GEM technology, a description of the ongoing GE1/1 project, and details of the GE2/1 and ME0 upgrade. We will focus in particular on the novel solutions adopted for realization of the latter project, with a summary of the ongoing R&D activities.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2
67	Study of discharges and their effects in GEM detectors	This study of the CMS GEM group focused on the precise measurement of the\r\ndischarge effects in GEM technologies. In particular, we investigate the resistance\r\nof GEM holes against electrical breakdown in different conditions of operation\r\n(e.g. RC component, gas, HV protection) and for different geometries. The initial\r\nstudy was performed with a single-hole setup in order to identify and isolate the\r\ncomponents that can influence the process the discharges. The investigations\r\nwere then scaled up to larger GEM sizes in order to validate the previous\r\nobservations and study additional effects such as the discharge propagation and\r\nthe damage probability.\r\nA systematic microscopic study was conducted together with the laboratory\r\ndevelopment in order to visualize the different types of damages that can be\r\ninduced by discharges.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2
68	MPA-SSA,  design and test of a 65 nm ASIC-based system for particle tracking at HL-LHC featuring on-chip particle discrimination.	Particle tracking detector for High Energy Physics needs new readout technique to cope with the increase of collision rate foreseen for the High Luminosity LHC upgrade. In particular, the selection of interesting physics events at the first trigger stage becomes extremely challenging at high luminosity, not only because of the rate increase, but also because selection algorithms become inefficient in high pileup conditions. A substantial increase of latency and trigger rate provides an improvement that is not sufficient to preserve the tracking performance of the current system. A possible solution consists in using tracking information for the event selection.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2
69	Lessons Learnt from the GE1/1 Slice Test	In January 2017, the CMS collaboration installed a set of double layer triple-GEM detectors on the negative endcap of the CMS detector as a “slice test” of an upgrade of the detector’s Forward Muon Spectrometer to be installed during the second-long shutdown (LS2) of the CERN LHC. It was an essential milestone of the GEM project in view of the installation of the entire GE1/1 station that will take place in LS2. The slice test provided a peerless test bench for the integration of the Data Acquisition and Detector Control Systems into the CMS stream. In this contribution we present the work performed on the GE1/1 slice test detectors, including production, installation, operation within the CMS framework and performance tests. Finally, the lessons learned from this experience will be emphasized. In particular, we will discuss the observation of front-end channel loss and the most recent techniques and design changes developed in order to mitigate this effect.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2

70	Low Gain Avalanche Detectors for Precision Timing in the CMS Endcap	The MIP Timing Detector (MTD) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is designed to provide precision timing information (with resolution of ~40 ps per layer) for charged particles, with hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |η|=3. This upgrade will reduce the effects of pile-up expected under the High Luminosity LHC running conditions and brings new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. The time information assigned to each track will enable the use of 4D reconstruction algorithms and will further discriminate in the time domain interaction vertices within the same bunch crossing to recover the track purity of vertices in current LHC conditions. The endcap region of the MTD, called the Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) will be instrumented with silicon-based low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs), covering the high radiation pseudo-rapidity region between |η|=1.6 and 3.0. Each endcap will be instrumented with a two-disk system of LGADs, read out by Endcap Timing Readout Chips (ETROCs), being designed for precision timing measurements. We present the status of the R&D for the MTD ETL and report on recent test beam results.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		807	2
71	Evolution of CMS Computing Model towards High Luminosity	The next LHC Runs, nominally RunIII and RunIV, pose problems to the offline and computing systems in CMS. RunIV in particular will needs completely different solutions, given the current estimates of LHC conditions and Trigger estimates. We want to report on the R&D process CMS has a whole has established, in order to gain insight on the needs and the possible solutions for the 2020+ CMS computing.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		800	2
72	Studies of light output and uniformity of scintillator materials for the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter	Due to its low price and fast time response, plastic scintillator is often used as the active medium in calorimeters for high energy physics experiments.  The High Granularity Calorimeter is an upgrade for the CMS detector for the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron collider, which will provide proton-proton collisions at a rate of 40 MHz and a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV.  The HGCAL will use dimpled scintillator tiles with on-tile silicon photomultiplier readout, similar to those used in CALICE calorimeter prototypes,  in the portions of the calorimeter where the expected radiation dose is below 300 krad.  The detector will operate at -30 degrees C.  We present studies of the tile light output and uniformity for different types of cast and extruded scintillator, for different types of reflective wrappings, and for different dimples.  Results are compared to predictions from a GEANT4-based optical simulation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		812	2
73	Production, Quality Control and Performance of the GEM detectors for the CMS Muon System upgrades	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be upgraded in several phases that will allow to significantly expanding its physics program. After the long shutdown in 2019 (LS2) the accelerator luminosity will be increased to 2 − 3 × 1034 cm^−2 s^−1 and later up to 5 × 10^34 cm^−2 s^−1 in 2024-26.            \r\nThe physics program of the LHC experiments will benefit from the augmented luminosity; the sensitivity of the CMS experiment to the new physics and to Standard Model will be fully exploited, providing that a suitable upgrade will enable the CMS detector to cope the future data-taking conditions.\r\nAmong the upgrades, the installation of new muon stations based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) technology in the endcap will start in early 2019 (GE1/1 station), followed by the installation of two additional stations (GE2/1 and ME0) in 2023.\r\nThe CMS GEM Collaboration produced the 144 GEM detectors to be installed in the GE1/1 station, sharing the assembly and testing of the detectors among several production sites spread all over the world. A detailed common assembly protocol and quality control procedure (QC) has been deployed, with the ambitious goal to ensure standardization of the performance of the detectors produced by the different sites.\r\nThe same procedure has been successfully adopted to test the first prototypes of the GE2/1 detectors.\r\nIn this contribution the final results of the QC tests performed on the GEM chambers, assembled by all the production sites following the common specification parameters, will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2
74	Precision Timing in the CMS MTD Barrel Timing Layer with Crystal Bars and SiPMs	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is undergoing an extensive Phase II upgrade program to prepare for the challenging conditions of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In particular, a new timing layer will measure minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with a time resolution of ~30-40 ps and hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |η|=3. The precision time information from this detector will reduce the effects of the high levels of pile-up expected at the HL-LHC and will bring new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. \r\nThis MIP Timing Detector (MTD) will consist of a central barrel timing layer (BTL) based on L(Y)SO:Ce crystals read out with SiPMs and two end-caps instrumented with radiation-tolerant Low Gain Avalanche Detectors. With the goal of maximizing the detector performance within the stringent constraints of space, cost, and channel count, the BTL exploits elongated crystal bars, each read out with two SiPMs. This unusual geometry enables the instrumentation of large surfaces while minimizing the active area of the photodetectors, and thus noise and power consumption. We will present the extensive R&D studies carried out to optimize this crystal-based technology and key beam test results in which the target time resolution of 30 ps has been achieved.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		812	2
75	GPU-based Offline Clustering Algorithm for the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter	The future upgraded High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is expected to deliver about 5 times higher instantaneous luminosity than the present LHC, producing pile-up up to 200 interactions per bunch crossing. As a part of its phase-II upgrade program, the CMS collaboration is developing a new end-cap calorimeter system, the High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL), featuring highly-segmented hexagonal silicon sensors (0.5-1.1 cm2) and scintillators (4-30 cm2), totalling more than 6 million channels in comparison to about 200k channels for the present CMS endcap calorimeters. For each event, the HGCAL clustering algorithm needs to reduce more than 100k hits into ~10k clusters, while keeping the fine shower structure. The same algorithm must reject pileup for further shower reconstruction. Due to the high pileup in the HL-LHC and high granularity, HGCAL clustering is confronted with an unprecedented surge of computation load. This motivates the concept of high-throughput heterogeneous computing in HGCAL offline clustering. Here we introduce a fully-parallelizable density-based clustering algorithm running on GPUs. It uses a tile-based data structure as input for a fast query of neighbouring cells and achieves an O(n) computational complexity. Within the CMS reconstruction framework, clustering on GPUs demonstrates at least a 10x throughout increase compared to current CPU-based clustering. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2

76	The CMS Run Registry: Data Certification and Publication System tool	\r\nThe Run Registry of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is the central tool to keep track of the results from the data quality monitoring scrutiny carried out by the collaboration. Recently it has been upgraded for the upcoming Run3 of LHC to a new web application which will replace the current version successfully used during Run1 and Run2. It consists of a Javascript web application frontend which connects to an PostgreSQL database in the backend. The data quality information is recorded for each Lumi Section, which corresponds approximately to 23 seconds of data taking at CMS. The new platform incorporates user feedback on shortcoming and support for new use cases like Machine Learning and interfaces. In this presentation we describe the architecture and the the commissioning of the service over the past months and the rest of long shutdown 2.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
77	Identification of new long-lived particle states using deep neural networks	We present preliminary studies of a deep neural network (DNN) "tagger" that is trained to identify the presence of displaced jets arising from the decays of new long-lived particle (LLP) states in data recorded by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Particle-level candidates, as well as secondary vertex information, are refined through the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) before being combined with high-level engineered variables via a dense neural network. The LLP lifetime is a parameter of the neural network model, which allows for hypothesis testing over several orders of magnitude in lifetime, from ctau = 1 um to 10 m. The network training is performed by streaming ROOT trees containing O(100M) jets directly into the TensorFlow queue and threading system. This custom workflow allows a flexible selection of input features and the asynchronous preprocessing of data, such as the resampling and shuffling of batches on the CPU, in parallel to training on the GPU. Domain adaptation is performed with CMS control region data to ensure that MC simulation can be used to accurately model candidate signal events in data. The technical implementation, architecture, workflows, and potential applications are described. We will demonstrate the tagger performance as evaluated with both MC simulation and control region data. Preliminary studies also demonstrate the potential for a universal, model-independent performance for a broad range of signal model hypotheses, such as long-lived resonances.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
78	Recording and reconstructing 10 billion unbiased B meson decays in CMS to probe lepton flavour universality	Measurements involving rare B meson decays by the LHCb and Belle Collaborations have revealed a number of anomalous results. Collectively, these anomalies are generating significant interest in the community, as they may be interpreted as a first sign of new physics in the lepton flavour sector. In 2018, the CMS experiment recorded an unprecedented data set containing the unbiased decays of 10 billion B mesons. These data allow attempts to measure the R_K, R_K*, and R_phi observables, which are considered to be theoretically robust and sensitive to a violation of lepton flavour universality. The accumulation, processing, and validation of this unprecedented data set was delivered with negligible impact on the core physics programme of CMS. Events were recorded with trigger rates in excess of 50 and 5 kHz at L1 and HLT, respectively, and a high average throughput of 2 GB/s. New algorithms have been developed to reconstruct and identify electrons with high efficiency at very low transverse momenta, as low as 0.5 GeV. These algorithms were validated using a pilot reconstruction campaign of O(10^9) events. The entire data set is currently being reconstructed and stored in the MINIAOD data format, along with a signal-enriched skim of events in the RAW data format that will aid the commissioning of the analysis techniques. We will review these activities, as well as future plans for Run 3. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
79	Using CMS Open Data for education, outreach and software benchmarking	The CMS collaboration at the CERN LHC has made more than one petabyte of open data available to the public, including large parts of the data which formed the basis for the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. Apart from their scientific value, these data can be used not only for education and outreach, but also for open benchmarks of analysis software. However, in their original format, the data cannot be accessed easily without experiment-specific knowledge and skills.\r\nWork is presented that allows to set up open analyses that are performed close to the published ones, but which meet minimum requirements for experiment-specific knowledge and software. The suitability of this approach for education and outreach is demonstrated with analyses that have been made fully accessible to the public via the CERN open data portal. In the second part of the talk, the value of these data as basis for benchmarks of analysis software under realistic conditions of a high-energy physics experiment is discussed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
80	Study of Discharges and their Effects in GEM Detectors	The CMS GEM group reports precise measurements of discharge effects in GEM technologies. In particular, we investigated the resistance of GEM holes against electrical breakdown in different conditions of operation (e.g. RC components, gas, HV protection) and for different geometries. The initial study was performed with a single-hole setup in order to identify and isolate the components that can influence the discharge process. Measurements were then made for larger GEM sizes in order to validate the previous observations and to study additional effects such as discharge propagation and damage probability. Microscopic studies were conducted together with the laboratory studies to visualize the different types of damage that can be induced by discharges.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		806	2

88	Moving the California distributed CMS xcache from bare metal into containers using Kubernetes	The University of California system has excellent networking between all of its campuses as well as a number of other Universities in CA, including Caltech, most of them being connected at 100 Gbps. UCSD and Caltech have thus joined their disk systems into a single logical xcache system, with worker nodes from both sites accessing data from disks at either site. This setup has been in place for a couple years now and has shown to work very well. Coherently managing nodes at multiple physical locations has however not been trivial, and we have been looking for ways to improve operations. With the Pacific Research Platform (PRP) now providing a Kubernetes resource pool spanning resources in the science DMZs of all the UC campuses, we have recently migrated the xcache services from being hosted bare-metal into containers. This talk presents our experience in both migrating to and operating in the new environment.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2

82	Upgrade of CMS non-event data infrastructure for the Run 3 High Level Trigger	The CMS experiment at CERN is working to improve the selection capability of the High Level Trigger (HLT) system, in view of the re-start of the collisions for Run 3.  One key factor on this scope is to enhance the ability of the Trigger  to track the detector evolution during the data taking, along with the LHC Fill cycles. In particular, the HLT performance is sensitive to two areas of varying conditions: \r\nthe evolution of the LHC luminous region parameters, changing frequently during the fill cycle,  and the radiation-induced effects on the detectors, that become relevant within long data collection runs. \r\nIn this context, the CMS Condition Database system has to fulfil the new requirements imposed, supporting the capability to deliver updates during the LHC fill with the required time granularity.\r\nIn this contribution, we present the solution that CMS has implemented on the combined system HLT-Condition Database for these purposes. The main strategy, that substantially confirms the adoption of Oracle RDBMS technology ( for the data storage ) and Frontier Web Proxy Caches ( for the read access Tier ) will be described. The requirements of Latency, Consistency, and Reproducibility imposed by the HLT multi-process architecture will be discussed in detail.  The results of the integration and stress tests will be also provided.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
83	Automatic log analysis with NLP for the CMS workflow handling	The central Monte-Carlo production of the CMS experiment utilizes the WLCG infrastructure and manages daily\r\nthousands of tasks, each up to thousands of jobs. \r\nThe distributed computing system is bound to sustain a certain rate of failures of various types, \r\nwhich are currently handled by computing operators a posteriori.\r\nWithin the context of computing operations, and operation intelligence, we propose a machine learning technique to learn from the operators with a view to reduce the operational workload and delays.\r\nThis work is in continuation of CMS work on operation intelligence to try and reach accurate predictions with machine learning.\r\nWe present an approach to consider the log files of the workflows as regular text to leverage modern techniques from \r\nnatural language processing (NLP). \r\nIn general, log files contain a substantial amount of text that is not human language.\r\nTherefore, different log parsing approaches are studied in order to\r\nmap the log files' words to high dimensional vectors. These vectors are \r\nthen exploited as feature space to train a model that predicts the action that the operator has to take.  This approach has the advantage that the information of the log files is extracted automatically and the format of the logs can be arbitrary.\r\nIn this work the performance of the log file analysis with NLP is presented and compared to previous approaches.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
84	Production, Quality Control and Performance of GE1/1 Detectors for the CMS Upgrade	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be upgraded in several phases that will allow significant expansion of its physics program. After the long shutdown in 2019 (LS2) the accelerator luminosity will be increased to 2 − 3 × 10^34 cm^−2 s^−1 and later up to 5 × 10^34 cm^−2 s^−1 in 2024-26. The physics program of the LHC experiments will benefit from the augmented luminosity; the sensitivity of the CMS experiment to the new physics and to the Standard Model will be fully exploited, providing that a suitable upgrade will enable the CMS detector to cope with future data-taking conditions. Among the upgrades, the installation of new muon stations based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) technology in the endcap will start in early 2019 (GE1/1 station), followed by the installation of two additional stations (GE2/1 and ME0) in 2023.

85	Modeling of the CMS HL-LHC computing system	The High-Luminosity LHC will provide an unprecedented data volume of complex collision events. The desire to keep as many of the "interesting" events for investigation by analysts implies a major increase in the scale of compute, storage and networking infrastructure required for HL-LHC experiments. An updated computing model is required to facilitate the timely publication of accurate physics results from HL-LHC data samples.  This talk discusses the study of the computing requirements for CMS during the era of the HL-LHC. We will discuss how we have included requirements beyond the usual CPU, disk and tape estimates made by LHC experiments during Run 2, such as networking and tape read/write rate requirements. We will show how Run 2 monitoring data has been used to make choices towards a HL-LHC computing model. We will illustrate how changes to the computing infrastructure or analysis approach can impact total resource needs and cost. Finally, we will discuss the approach and status of the CMS process for evolving its HL-LHC computing model based on modeling and other factors.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2

87	NANOAOD: a new compact event data format in CMS	The CMS Collaboration has recently commissioned a new compact data format, named NANOAOD, reducing the per-event compressed size to about 1-2 kB. This is achieved by retaining only high level information on physics objects, and aims at supporting a considerable fraction of CMS physics analyses with a ~20x reduction in disk storage needs. NANOAOD also facilitates the dissemination of analysis methods and the automation of standard workflows for deriving conditions and object calibrations.

A software trigger system requires a trade-off between the complexity of the algorithms running on the available computing resources, the sustainable output rate, and the selection efficiency.\r\nDuring its “Phase 2” the LHC will reach a luminosity of 7×10³⁴ cm⁻²s⁻¹ with a pileup of 200 collisions, integrating over 3000 fb⁻¹ over the full experimental run. To fully exploit the higher luminosity, the CMS experiment will introduce a more advanced Level 1 Trigger and increase the full readout rate from 100 kHz to 750 kHz. The higher luminosity, event complexity and input rate present an unprecedented challenge to the High Level Trigger, that aims to achieve a similar efficiency and rejection factor as today despite the higher pileup and more pure preselection.\r\nIn this presentation we will discuss the ongoing studies and prospects for the online reconstruction and selection algorithms for the high-luminosity era.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
91	Evolution of the CMS Global Submission Infrastructure for the HL-LHC Era	Efforts in distributed computing of the CMS experiment at the LHC at CERN are now focusing on the functionality required to fulfill the projected needs for the HL-LHC era. Cloud and HPC resources are expected to be dominant relative to resources provided by traditional Grid sites, being also much more diverse and heterogeneous. Handling their special capabilities or limitations and maintaining global flexibility and efficiency, while also operating at scales much higher than the current capacity, are the major challenges being addressed by the CMS Submission Infrastructure team. This contribution will discuss the risks to the stability and scalability of the CMS HTCondor infrastructure extrapolated to such a scenario, thought to be derived mostly from its growing complexity, with multiple Negotiators and schedulers flocking work to multiple federated pools. New mechanisms for enhanced customization and control over resource allocation and usage, mandatory in this future scenario, will be also presented. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
92	The CMS ECAL Upgrade for Precision Crystal Calorimetry and Timing at the HL-LHC	The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment (CMS) is a homogeneous calorimeter made of about 75000 lead tungstate scintillating crystals. It has been operating at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy and a bunch spacing of 25 ns since 2015. Challenging running conditions for CMS are expected after the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC). We review the design and R&D studies for the CMS ECAL barrel crystal calorimeter upgrade and present first test beam studies performed in the SPS H4 beam line. Particular challenges at the HL-LHC are the harsh radiation environment, the increasing data rates, and the extreme level of pile-up events, with up to 200 simultaneous proton-proton collisions. We present test beam results of the new readout and trigger electronics, which must be upgraded due to the increased trigger and latency requirements at the HL-LHC. In addition, particle detectors with a timing resolution of order 10 ps can tremendously improve event reconstruction at high luminosity hadron colliders. The CMS ECAL barrel upgrade will achieve a timing resolution of around 30 ps for high energy photons and electrons. The benefits of precision timing for the ECAL event reconstruction at HL-LHC will be discussed in this presentation. Simulation and test beam studies carried out for the timing upgrade of the CMS ECAL barrel will be presented, and the prospects for a full implementation of this option will be discussed.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		812	2
93	Lightweight site federation for CMS support	There is a general trend in WLCG towards the federation of resources, aiming for increased simplicity, efficiency, flexibility, and availability. Although general, VO-agnostic federation of resources between two independent and autonomous resource centres may prove arduous, a considerable amount of flexibility in resource sharing can be achieved, in the context of a single WLCG VO, with a relatively simple approach. We have demonstrated this for PIC and CIEMAT, the Spanish Tier-1 and Tier-2 sites for CMS (separated by 600 Kms, ~10 ms latency), by making use of the existing CMS xrootd federation (AAA) infrastructure and profiting from the common CE/batch technology used by the two centres (HTCondor). This work describes how compute slots are shared between the two sites with transparent and efficient access to the input data irrespective of its location. This approach allows to dynamically increase the capacity of a site with idle execution slots from the remote site. Our contribution also includes measurements for diverse CMS workflows comparing performances between local and remote execution. In addition to enabling an increased flexibility in the use of the resources, this lightweight approach can be regarded as a benchmark to explore future potential scenarios, where storage resources would be concentrated in a reduced number of sites. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
94	Exploiting network restricted compute resources with HTCondor: a CMS experiment experience	In view of the increasing computing needs for the HL-LHC era, the LHC experiments are exploring new ways to access, integrate and use non-Grid compute resources. Accessing and making efficient use of Cloud and supercomputer (HPC) resources present a diversity of challenges. In particular, network limitations from the compute nodes in HPC centers impede CMS experiment pilot jobs to connect to its central HTCondor pool to receive the actual payload jobs to be executed. To cope with this limitation, new features have been developed in both HTCondor and the CMS resource scheduling and workload management infrastructure. In this novel approach, a bridge is set up outside the HPC center and the communications between HTCondor daemons are relayed through a shared file system. We have used this strategy to exploit the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) resources, the main Spanish HPC site. CMS payloads are claimed by HTCondor startd daemons running at the nearby PIC Tier-1 center and routed to BSC compute nodes through the bridge. This fully enables the connectivity of CMS HTCondor-based central infrastructure to BSC resources via PIC HTCondor pool. Other challenges have included building custom Singularity images with CMS software releases, bringing conditions data to payload jobs, and custom data handling between BSC and PIC. This contribution describes this technical prototype, its deployment, the functionality and scalability tests performed, along with the results obtained when exploiting the BSC resources using these novel approaches. A key aspect of the technique described in this contribution is that it could be universally employed in similar HPC environments elsewhere.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2

97	DAQExpert - the service to increase CMS data-taking efficiency	The Data Acquisition (DAQ) system of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at LHC is a complex system responsible for the data readout, event building and recording of accepted events. Its proper functioning plays a critical role in the data-taking efficiency of the CMS experiment. In order to ensure high availability and recover promptly in the event of hardware or software failure of the subsystems, an expert system, the DAQ Expert, has been developed. It aims at improving the data taking efficiency, reducing the human error in the operations and minimising the on-call expert demand. Introduced in the beginning of 2017, it assists the shift crew and the system experts in recovering from operational faults, streamlining the post mortem analysis and, at the end of Run 2, triggering the fully automatic recoveries without a human intervention. DAQ Expert analyses the real-time monitoring data originating from the DAQ components and the high-level trigger updated every few seconds. It pinpoints the data flow problem and recovers it automatically or after given operator approval. We analyse the CMS downtime in the 2018 run focusing on what was improved with the introduction of automated recoveries; present challenges and design of transforming the expert knowledge to automated recovery jobs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the web-based, ReactJS interfaces that ensure an effective cooperation between the human operators in control room and the automated recovery system. We report on the operational experience with automated recoveries.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
98	Heterogeneous reconstruction: combining an ARM processor with a GPU	As the mobile ecosystem has demonstrated, ARM processors and GPUs promise to deliver higher compute efficiency with a lower power consumption. One interesting platform to experiment with architectures different from a traditional x86 machine is the NVIDIA AGX Xavier SoC, that pairs a  64-bit ARM processor 8 cores with a Volta-class GPU with 512 CUDA cores.\r\nThe CMS reconstruction software was ported to run on the ARM architecture, and there is an ongoing effort to rewrite some of the most time-consuming algorithms to leverage NVIDIA GPUs. In this presentation we will explore the challenges of running the CMS reconstruction software on a smll embedded device, and compare its compute performance and power consumption with those of a traditional x86 server.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
99	Modernizing the CMS software stack	The CMS experiment relies on a substantial C++ and Python-based software\r\nrelease for its day-to-day production, operations and analysis needs. While very\r\nmuch under active development, this codebase continues to age. At the same time, CMSSW codes \r\nare likely to be used for the next two decades, in one form or another. Thus, the "cost" of \r\nbugs entering CMSSW continues to increase, both due to the increasing scale of production\r\nand analysis activities and due to the increased time to identify bugs in a legacy system.\r\nThe software integration system for CMSSW must therefore continue to evolve to include modern tools, to provide developers with better information for debugging, and to give code reviewers more tools for code quality evaluation. This talk will describe the approach and results from recent changes to CMSSW including the addition of code formatting checks, the integration of accelerators into build and test procedures, and changing the CMS software base and development platform from Python2 to Python3. We will discuss the continued enhancement of the CMS continuous integration systems based on GitHub and Jenkins as well as the adoption of new code analytics tools.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
100	The CMS approach to Analysis Preservation	The CERN analysis preservation portal (CAP) comprises a set of tools and services aiming to assist researchers in describing and preserving all the components of a physics analysis such as data, software and computing environment. Together with the associated documentation, all these assets are kept in one place so that the analysis can be fully or partially reused even several years after the publication of the original scientific results.  \r\nAn experiment-specific submission and retrieval interface has been developed for the CMS collaboration.\r\nIt integrates with the CMS internal analysis registry (CADI) to capture all analyses with basic information, complemented with a detailed submission form for full information. The CMS data aggregation system (DAS)  is interfaced to the deposit form to assist in filling in exact dataset names used in the analysis to ensure searchability.\r\nEfforts are ongoing to describe physics content for an intelligent retrieval, and to interface with container solutions for full reproducibility for selected test cases. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
101	CMS Strategy for HPC resource exploitation	High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments will enter a new era with the start of the HL-LHC program, where computing needs required will surpass by large factors the current capacities. Looking forward to this scenario, funding agencies from participating countries are encouraging the HEP collaborations to consider the rapidly developing High Performance Computing (HPC) international infrastructures as a mean to satisfy at least a fraction of the foreseen HEP processing demands. Moreover, considering that HEP needs have been usually covered by facilities cost-optimized rather than performance-optimized, employing HPC centers would also allow access to more advanced resources. \r\nHPC systems are highly non-standard facilities, custom­-built for use cases largely different from CMS demands, namely the processing of real and simulated particle collisions which can be analyzed individually without any correlation. The utilization of these systems by HEP experiments would not trivial, as each HPC center is different, increasing the level of complexity from the CMS integration and operations perspectives. Additionally, while CMS data is residing on a distributed highly-interconnected storage infrastructure, HPC systems are in general not meant for accessing large data volumes residing outside the facility. Finally, the allocation policies to these resources is quite different from the current usage of pledged resources deployed at CMS supporting Grid sites. \r\nThis contribution will report on the CMS strategy developed to make effective use of HPC resources, involving a closer collaboration between CMS and HPC centers in order to further understand and subsequently overcome the present obstacles. Progress in the necessary technical and operational adaptations being made in CMS computing will be described. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
102	Transitioning CMS to Rucio Data Management	Following a thorough review in 2018, the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC decided to adopt Rucio as its new data management system. Rucio is emerging as a community software project and will replace an aging CMS-only system before the start-up of LHC Run 3 in 2021. Rucio was chosen after an evaluation determined that Rucio could meet the technical and scale needs of CMS. The data management system for CMS needs to manage the current data sample (approximately 200 PB of data with 1 PB of transfers per day) and have a development path suitable for LHC Run 4 (2026) data rates, which are expected to be 50 times larger.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2

103	The CMS Data Acquisition System for the Phase-2 Upgrade	The upgraded High Luminosity LHC, after the third Long Shutdown (LS3) will provide an instantaneous luminosity of 7.5 1034 cm-2 s-1 (levelled), with a pileup of up to 200 interactions per bunch crossing. During LS3, the CMS Detector will undergo a major upgrade to prepare for the Phase-2 of the LHC physics program, starting around 2026. The upgraded CMS detector will be read out at an unprecedented data rate of up to 50 Tb/s with an event rate of 750 kHz, selected by the level-1 hardware trigger, and an average event size of 7.5 MB. Complete events will be analysed by the High Level Trigger (HLT) using software algorithms running on standard processing nodes, and selected events will be stored permanently at a rate of up to 7.5 kHz for offline processing and analysis. Tis paper will present, the baseline design of the DAQ and HLT systems for Phase-2, taking into account the projected evolution of high speed network fabrics for event building and distribution, and the anticipated performance of general purpose CPU. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
104	Engaging the youth in programming and physics through an online educational activity	The rapid economic growth is building new trends in careers. Almost every domain, including high-energy physics, needs people with strong capabilities in programming. In this evolving environment, it is highly desirable that young people are equipped with computational thinking (CT) skills, such as problem-solving and logical thinking, as well as the ability to develop software applications and write code.  These are crucial elements of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education (STEM).	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
105	CMS data access and usage studies at PIC Tier-1 and CIEMAT Tier-2	Computing needs projections for the HL-LHC era (2026+), following the current computing models, indicate that much larger resource increases would be required than those that technology evolution at a constant budget could bring. Since worldwide budget for computing is not expected to increase, many research activities have emerged to improve the performance of the LHC processing software applications, as well as to propose more efficient deployment scenarios and techniques which might alleviate the increase of expected resources for the HL-LHC. The massively increasing amounts of data to be processed leads to enormous challenges for HEP storage systems, networks and the data distribution to end-users. This is particularly important in scenarios in which the LHC data would be distributed from sufficiently small numbers of centers holding the experiment’s data. Enabling data locality via local caches on sites seems a very promising approach to hide transfer latencies while reducing the deployed storage space and number of replicas elsewhere. However, this highly depends on the workflow I/O characteristics and available network across sites. A crucial assessment is to study how the experiments are accessing and using the storage services deployed in sites in WLCG, to properly evaluate and simulate the benefits for several of the new emerging proposals within WLCG/HSF. In order to evaluate access and usage of storage, this contribution shows data access and popularity studies for the CMS Workflows executed in the Spanish Tier-1 (PIC) and Tier-2 (CIEMAT) sites supporting CMS activities, based on local and experiment monitoring data spanning more than one year. Simulations of data caches for end-user analysis data, as well as potential areas for storage savings will be reviewed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
106	The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter workflow	The CMS experiment at the LHC features the largest crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) ever built. It consists of about 75000 scintillating lead tungstate crystals. The ECAL crystal energy response is fundamental for both triggering purposes and offline analysis. Due to the challenging LHC radiation environment, the response of both crystals and photodetectors to particles evolves with time. Therefore continuous monitoring and correction of the ageing effects plays a key role in ensuring stability of trigger efficiency and rate, as well as optimal offline physics performance. Fast, reliable and efficient workflows are set up to have the first set of corrections computed within 48 hours of data-taking, making use of dedicated data streams and processing. Such corrections, stored in relational databases (Oracle), are then accessed during the prompt offline reconstruction of CMS data. Twice a week, the calibrations used at the trigger level (hardware and software) are also updated in the database and accessed during the data-taking. Dedicated workflows for the prompt validation of the conditions are also available, together with a monitoring of the data quality. In this presentation, the design of the CMS ECAL data handling, processing, and validation is reviewed, and results from the main workflows are discussed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
107	Smart caching at CMS: applying AI to XCache edge services	The envisaged Storage and Compute needs for the HL-LHC will be a factor up to 10 above what can be achieved by the evolution of current technology within a flat budget. The WLCG community is studying possible technical solutions to evolve the current computing in order to cope with the requirements; one of the main focuses is resource optimization, with the ultimate objective of improving performance and efficiency as well as simplifying and reducing operation costs. As of today the storage consolidation based on a Data Lake model is considered a good candidate for addressing HL-LHC data access challenges, allowing global redundancy instead of local redundancy, dynamic adaptation of QoS, intelligent data deployment based on cost driven metrics. A Data Lake model under evaluation can be seen as a logical entity which hosts a distributed working set of analysis data. Compute power can be close to the lake, but also remote and thus completely external. In this context we expect Data caching to play a central role as a technical solution to reduce the impact of latency and reduce network load. A geographically distributed caching layer will be functional to many satellite computing centers might appear and disappear dynamically. In this talk we propose to develop a flexible and automated AI environment for smart management of the content of clustered cache systems,  to optimize hardware for the service and operations for maintenance. In this talk we demonstrate a AI-based smart caching system, and discuss the implementation of training and inference facilities along with the XCache integration with the smart decision service. Finally, we evaluate the effect on smart-caches and data placement, and compare data placement algorithm with and without ML model.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
108	Data access pattern analysis and modeling	In this paper we studied patterns of usage based on the traces and logs from the  data and workflow management systems of CMS and ATLAS,  and simulated the impact of different caching and data lifecycle management approaches. Cost estimates for the different scenarios are part of the studies. Data corresponding to one year of operation, covering all grid sites, have been the basis for the analysis. For selected sites, this data has been augmented by access logs of storage system to also include data accesses not managed via the standard experiments workflow management systems. We present the results of the studies, the tools developed and the experiences with the data analysis frameworks used.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
109	Overview of the HL-LHC Upgrade for the CMS Level-1 Trigger	The High-Luminosity LHC will open an unprecedented window on the weak-scale nature of the universe, providing high-precision measurements of the standard model as well as searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Such precision measurements and searches require information-rich datasets with a statistical power that matches the high-luminosity provided by the Phase-2 upgrade of the LHC. Efficiently collecting those datasets will be a challenging task, given the harsh environment of 200 proton-proton interactions per LHC bunch crossing. For this purpose, CMS is designing an efficient data-processing hardware trigger (Level-1) that will include tracking information and high-granularity calorimeter information. The current conceptual system design is expected to take full advantage of advances in FPGA and link technologies over the coming years, providing a high-performance, low-latency computing platform for large throughput and sophisticated data correlation across diverse sources.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
110	WLCG Web Proxy Auto Discovery for Dynamically Created Web Proxies	The WLCG Web Proxy Auto Discovery (WPAD) service provides a convenient mechanism for jobs running anywhere on the WLCG to dynamically discover web proxy cache servers that are nearby.  The web proxy caches are general purpose for a number of different http applications, but different applications have different usage characteristics and not all proxy caches are engineered to work with the heaviest loads.  For this reason, the initial sources of information for WLCG WPAD were the static configurations that ATLAS and CMS maintain for the Conditions data that they read through the Frontier Distributed Database system, which is the most demanding popular WLCG application for web proxy caches.  That works well for use at traditional statically defined WLCG sites, but now that usage of commercial clouds is increasing, there is also a need for web proxy caches to dynamically register themselves as they are created.  A package called Shoal had already been created to manage dynamically created web proxy caches.  This paper describes the integration of the Shoal package into the WLCG WPAD system, such that both staticly and dynamically created web proxy caches can be located from a single source.  It also describes other improvements to the WLCG WPAD system since the last CHEP publication.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
111	Operational Intelligence	In the near future, large scientific collaborations will face unprecedented computing challenges. Processing and storing exabyte datasets require a federated infrastructure of distributed computing resources. The current systems have proven to be mature and capable of meeting the experiment goals, by allowing timely delivery of scientific results. However, a substantial amount of interventions from software developers, shifters and operational teams is needed to efficiently manage such heterogeneous infrastructures. For instance, every year thousands of tickets are submitted to ATLAS and CMS issue tracking systems, hence further processed by the experiment operators. On the other hand, logging information from computing services and systems is being archived on ElasticSearch, Hadoop, and NoSQL data stores. Such a wealth of information can be exploited to increase the level of automation in computing operations by using adequate techniques, such as machine learning (ML), tailored to solve specific problems. ML models applied to the prediction of intelligent data placements and access patterns can help to increase the efficiency of resource exploitation and the overall throughput of the experiments distributed computing infrastructures. Time-series analyses may allow for the estimation of the time needed to complete certain tasks, such as processing a certain number of events or transferring a certain amount of data. Anomaly detection techniques can be employed to predict system failures, leading for example to network congestion. Recording and analyzing shifter actions can be used to automate tasks such as submitting tickets to support centers, or to suggest possible solutions to repeating issues. \r\nThe Operational Intelligence project is a joint effort from various WLCG communities aimed at increasing the level of automation in computing operations. We discuss how state-of-the-art technologies can be used to build general solutions to common problems and to reduce the operational cost of the experiment computing infrastructure. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
112	Status and future of the CMS Tracker DCS	Detector Control Systems (DCS) for modern High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments are based on complex distributed (and often redundant) hardware and software implementing real-time operational procedures meant to ensuring that the detector is always in a "safe" state, while at the same time maximizing the live time of the detector during beam collisions. Display, archival and often analysis of the "environmental" data are also part of the tasks assigned to DCS systems.\r\nThe CMS Tracker DCS is a resilient system that has been designed to safely operate the Silicon Strip and the Pixel detectors of the CMS detector. It has been built on top of an industrial Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software product (WinCC OA) extended with the JCOP framework developed at CERN along with CMS and Tracker specific components.\r\n The Tracker control system is at present undergoing major component re-work which is critical to ensure a smooth Run 3 and a workable baseline for the Phase-2 Tracker upgrade.\r\nIn this talk we will present an overview of the Tracker DCS, which has been operational for over 12 years, during which it has been continuously modified by several different hands, and of the major development challenges we are facing.\r\nFurthermore, we will discuss a generic way to build an automated test environment that ensures the proper functionality of different parts of the system. This includes defining test scenarios that cover individual components, integration and system testing using Kubernetes and Gitlab runners.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
113	Concurrent Conditions Access across Validity Intervals in CMSSW	The CMS software system, known as CMSSW, has a generalized conditions, calibration, and geometry data products system called the EventSetup. The EventSetup caches results of reading or calculating data products based on the 'interval of validity', IOV, which is based on the time period for which that data product is appropriate. With the original single threaded CMSSW framework, updating only on an IOV boundary meant we only required memory for a single data product of a given type at any time during the program execution. In 2016 CMS transitioned to using a multi-threaded framework as a way to save on memory during processing. This was accomplished by amortizing the memory cost of EventSetup data products across multiple concurrent events. To initially accomplish that goal required synchronizing event processing across IOV boundaries, thereby decreasing the scalability of the system. In this presentation we will explain how we used 'limited concurrent task queues' to allow concurrent IOVs while still being able to limit the memory utilized. In addition, we will present performance measurements for both threading scalability of event throughtput and memory utilization.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
149	Search for heavy resonances in diboson final states at CMS	Searches for new resonances in di-boson final states (VV, VH, HH, where V = W, Z) with the CMS detector are presented. The results are based on the large dataset collected during Run 2 of the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The analyses are optimised for high sensitivity over a large range in resonance mass. Jet substructure techniques are used to identify hadronic decays of highly-boosted W, Z, and H bosons. A statistical combination of these searches provides the most stringent constraints on heavy vector bosons with large couplings to standard model bosons and fermions.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		825	2

114	CMS Event-Builder Performance on State-of-the-Art Hardware	We report on performance measurements and optimizations of the event-builder software for the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The CMS event builder collects event fragments from several hundred sources. It assembles them into complete events that are then handed to the High-Level Trigger (HLT) processes running on O(1000) computers. We use a test system with 16 dual-socket Skylake-based computers interconnected with 100 Gbps Infiniband and Ethernet networks. The main challenge is the demanding message rate and memory performance required of the event-builder node to fully exploit the network capabilities. Each event-builder node has to process several TCP/IP streams from the detector backends at an aggregated bandwidth of 100 Gbps, distribute event fragments to other event-builder nodes at the fist level trigger rate of 100 kHz, verify and build complete events using fragments received from all other nodes, and finally make the complete events available to the HLT processors. The achievable performance on today's hardware and different system architectures is described. Furthermore, we compare native Infiniband with RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet). We discuss the required optimizations and highlight some of the problems encountered. We conclude with an outlook on the baseline CMS event-builder design for the LHC Run 3 starting in 2021.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
115	Calibration and Performance of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter in LHC Run2	Many physics analyses using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC require accurate, high resolution electron and photon energy measurements. Excellent energy resolution is crucial for studies of Higgs boson decays with electromagnetic particles in the final state, as well as searches for very high mass resonances decaying to energetic photons or electrons. The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a fundamental instrument for these analyses and its energy resolution is crucial for the Higgs boson mass measurement. \r\nRecently the energy response of the calorimeter has been precisely calibrated exploiting the full Run2 data, aiming at a legacy reprocessing of the data. A dedicated calibration of each detector channel has been performed with physics events exploiting electrons from W and Z boson decays, photons from pi0/eta decays, and from the azimuthally symmetric energy distribution of minimum bias events. \r\nThis talk presents the calibration strategies that have been implemented and the excellent performance achieved by the CMS ECAL with the ultimate calibration of Run II data, in terms of energy scale stability and energy resolution.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
116	CMS Experience with Adoption of the Community-supported DD4hep Toolkit	DD4hep is an open-source software toolkit that provides comprehensive and complete generic detector descriptions for high energy physics (HEP) detectors. The Compact Muon Solenoid collaboration (CMS) has recently evaluated and adopted DD4hep to replace its custom detector\r\ndescription software. CMS has demanding software requirements as a very large, long-running experiment that must support legacy geometries and study many possible upgraded detector designs of a constantly evolving detector that will be taking data for many years to come.  CMS has chosen\r\nDD4hep since it is a high-quality, community-supported solution that will benefit from continuing modernization and maintenance.  This presentation will discuss the issues of DD4hep adoption, the advantages and disadvantages of the various design choices, performance results, and the integration of the plugin systems from CMS and Gaudi, another open-source software framework. Recommendations about DD4hep based upon the CMS use cases will also be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
117	Using OpenMP for HEP Framework Algorithm Scheduling	The OpenMP standard is the primary mechanism used at high performance computing facilities to allow intra-process parallelization. In contrast, many HEP specific software (such as CMSSW, GaudiHive, and ROOT) make use of Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library to accomplish the same goal. In this talk we will discuss our work to compare TBB and OpenMP when used for scheduling algorithms to be run by a HEP style data processing framework (i.e. running hundreds of interdependent algorithms at most once for each event read from the detector). This includes both scheduling of different algorithms to be run concurrently as well as scheduling concurrent work within one algorithm. As part of the discussion we present an overview of the OpenMP threading model.  We also explain how we used OpenMP when creating a simplified HEP-like processing framework. Using that simplified framework, and a similar one written using TBB, we will present performance comparisons between TBB and different compiler versions of OpenMP.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
118	Managing an evolving distributed monitoring system based on Elasticsearch with continuous integration in CMS data acquisition system	CMS data acquisition system's readout and event building encompass a large number of interdependent distributed applications in a network. Applications are regularly monitored to ensure correct behaviour of the system. Monitoring data consist of various combinations of variables of different types as defined in metadata. They evolve frequently according to new requirements during the operation of the experiment. This paper describes a flexible and scalable approach to consistently define monitoring data for all the use cases in CMS. The proposed solution allows support of non-disruptive extensibility for multiple users within different administrative domains and multiple versions of data. Available off-the-shelf technologies like Elasticsearch and Gitlab give the necessary tools to establish the required infrastructure. Elasticsearch has a dual role to store both monitoring data as well as corresponding metadata. The advantageous functionalities provided by Gitlab to support multiple projects independently fit well with the secure management of different administrative domains. Standard capabilities of Git provide consistent versioning and extensibility of monitoring metadata. Monitoring applications distributed over the network can locate and retrieve the required configuration in an efficient manner. Gitlab CI facilities automate the work of deploying a given version of a configuration from the Git repository into Elasticsearch for direct use with a safe and consistent method.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2

119	Big data solutions for CMS computing monitoring and analytics	The CMS computing infrastructure is composed by several subsystems that accomplish complex tasks such as workload and data management, transfers, submission of user and centrally managed production requests. Till recently, most subsystems were monitored through custom tools and web applications, and logging information was scattered in several sources and typically accessible only by experts. In the last year CMS computing fostered the adoption of common big data solutions based on open-source, scalable, and no-SQL tools, such as Hadoop, InfluxDB, and ElasticSearch, available through the CERN IT infrastructure. Such system allows for the easy deployment of monitoring and accounting applications using visualisation tools such as Kibana and Graphana. Alarms can be raised when anomalous conditions in the monitoring data are met, and the relevant teams are automatically notified. Data sources from different subsystems are used to build complex workflows and predictive analytics (data popularity, smart caching, transfer latency, …), and for performance studies. We describe the full software architecture and data flow, the CMS computing data sources and monitoring applications, and show how the stored data can be used to gain insights into the various subsystems by exploiting scalable solutions based on Spark.  \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
120	40 MHz Level-1 Trigger Scouting for CMS	The CMS experiment will be upgraded for operation at the High-Luminosity LHC to maintain and extend its optimal physics performance under extreme pileup conditions. Upgrades will include an entirely new tracking system, supplemented by a track trigger processor capable of providing tracks at Level-1, as well as a high-granularity calorimeter in the endcap region. New front-end and back-end electronics will also provide the level-1 trigger with high-resolution information from the barrel calorimeter and the muon systems. The upgraded Level-1 processors, based on powerful FPGAs, will be able to carry out sophisticated feature searches with resolutions often similar to the offline ones, while keeping pileup effects under control. \r\nIn this paper, we discuss the feasibility of a system capturing Level-1 intermediate data at the beam-crossing rate of 40 MHz and carrying out online analyses based on these limited-resolution data. \r\nThis 40 MHz scouting system would provide fast and virtually unlimited statistics for detector diagnostics, alternative luminosity measurements and, in some cases, calibrations, and it has the potential to enable the study of otherwise inaccessible signatures, either too common to fit in the L1 accept budget, or with requirements which are orthogonal to “mainstream” physics, such as long-lived particles.\r\nWe discuss the requirements and possible architecture of a Phase-2 40 MHz scouting system, as well as some of the physics potential, and results from a demonstrator operated at the end of Run-2 using the Global Muon Trigger data from CMS. Plans for further demonstrators envisaged for Run 3 are also discussed.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
121	COFFEA - Columnar Object Framework For Effective Analysis	The COFFEA Framework provides a new approach to HEP analysis, via columnar operations, that improves time-to-insight, scalability, portability, and reproducibility of analysis. It is implemented with the Python programming language and commodity big data technologies such as Apache Spark and NoSQL databases. To achieve this suite of improvements across many use cases, COFFEA takes a factorized approach, separating the analysis implementation and data delivery scheme. All analysis operations are implemented using the NumPy or awkward-array packages which are wrapped to yield user code whose purpose is quickly intuited. Various data delivery schemes are wrapped into a common front-end which accepts user inputs and code, and returns user defined outputs. We will present published results from analysis of CMS data using the COFFEA framework along with a discussion of metrics and the user experience of arriving at those results with columnar analysis.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
122	The CMS DAQ pinball machine	We present an interactive game for up to seven players that demonstrates the challenges of on-line event selection at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment to the public. The game - in the shape of a popular classic pinball machine - was conceived and prototyped by an interdisciplinary team of graphic designers, physicists and engineers at the CMS Create hackathon in 2016. Having won the competition, the prototype was turned into a fully working machine that is now exhibited on the CMS visitor's path. Teams of 2-7 visitors can compete with one another to collect as many interesting events as possible within a simulated LHC fill. In a fun and engaging way, the game conveys concepts such as multi-level triggering, pipelined processing, event building, the importance of purity in event selection and more subtle details such as dead time. The multi-player character of the game corresponds to the distributed nature of the actual trigger and data acquisition system of the experiment. We present the concept of the game, its design and its technical implementation centred around an Arduino micro-controller controlling 700 RGB LEDs and a sound subsystem running on a Mac mini. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2
123	Open data provenance and reproducibility: a case study from publishing CMS open data	In this paper we present the latest CMS open data release published on \r\nthe CERN Open Data portal. The samples of raw datasets, collision and simulated \r\ndatasets were released together with the detailed information about the data \r\nprovenance.\r\nThe data production chain covers the necessary compute environments, the\r\nconfiguration files and the computational procedures used in each data\r\nproduction step. We describe data curation techniques used to obtain and \r\npublish the data provenance information and we study the possibility to \r\nreproduce parts of the released data using the publicly available information. The \r\npresent work demonstrates the usefulness of releasing selected samples of raw and \r\nprimary data in order to fully ensure the completeness of information about data\r\nproduction chain for the attention of general data scientists and other\r\nnon-specialists interested in using particle physics data for education or\r\nresearch purposes.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2

124	Bringing heterogeneity to the CMS software framework	The advent of computing resources with co-processors, for example Graphics Processing Units (GPU) or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), for use cases like the CMS High-Level Trigger (HLT) or data processing at leadership-class supercomputers imposes challenges for the current data processing frameworks. These challenges include developing a model for algorithms to offload their computations on the co-processors as well as keeping the traditional CPU busy doing other work. The CMS data processing framework, CMSSW, implements multithreading using the Intel’s Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library, that utilizes tasks as concurrent units of work. In this talk we will discuss a generic mechanism to interact effectively with non-CPU resources that has been implemented in CMSSW. In addition, configuring such a heterogeneous system is challenging. In CMSSW an application is configured with a configuration file written in the Python language. The algorithm types are part of the configuration. The challenge therefore is to unify the CPU and co-processor settings while allowing their implementations to be separate. We will explain how we solved these challenges while minimizing the necessary changes to the CMSSW framework. We will also discuss on a concrete example how algorithms would offload work to NVIDIA GPUs using directly the CUDA API.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		797	2

127	LiTE-DTU: online data selection, compression, and transmission ASIC for the upgraded front-end of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is operating at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy and with 25 ns bunch spacing. The High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will require a significant upgrade of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) in order to maintain good detector performance in the harsh radiation environment, increasing data rates, and higher level of pile-up events of the HL-LHC. The very front-end (VFE) readout electronics have been completely redesigned, with goals of providing precision timing, low noise, and sampling rate four times higher than the current one. This paper focuses on the LiTe-DTU ASIC that is a fully digital data transmission unit which performs online data selection, online lossless compression, and high-speed serial transmission. I will report on the ASIC architecture, the selected methods for data selection and compression, data format, and techniques for mitigation of radiation damage mitigation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		817	2

168	FCNC and EFT interpretations at LHC	(Includes EFT interpretation of ttV)\r\nTop quark production can probe physics beyond the SM in different ways. Some processes, and especially certain angular correlations, are sensitive to the existence of anomalous top quark couplings.\r\n In the SM, flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC) are forbidden at tree level and are strongly suppressed in loop corrections. Several extensions of the SM incorporate significantly enhanced FCNC behaviour that can be directly probed in top quark processes.\r\n Current approaches adopting an EFT framework allow describing effects of new physics in a model independent way. This talk reviews the current limits on FCNC searches in the top sector, and EFT interpretations.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		825	2

The analysis is performed using a parametric simulation of the Phase-2 CMS detector response provided by the Delphes software and assuming an average of 200 proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. Assuming a projected integrated luminosity of 3000 fb^{−1}, the expected significance for the non-resonant Standard Model (SM) signal is 0.37 σ; a 95% confidence level (CL) upper limit on its cross section is set to 6.6 times the SM prediction. \r\nThe statistical combination of five decay channels (bbbb, bbWW, bbττ, bbγγ, and bbZZ) results in an expected significance for the standard model HH signal of 2.6 σ and an expected 68% and 95% CL intervals for the self-coupling modifier κλ=λ_{HHH}/λ_{HHH}^{SM} of [0.35, 1.9] and [−0.18, 3.6], respectively.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		818	2
216	Precise Timing Measurement for the CMS Upgrade and Beyond	In this contribution, I review growing interest in large area fast timing detectors based on Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) with a timing resolution of 30-50ps. Combining precise timing of minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with tracking significantly benefits performance of the detector by improving resolution and background rejection. Large-scale high-precision timing detectors have to face formidable challenges in almost every aspect:  performance of sensors, segmentation and radiation tolerance, very low-power and low-noise electronics, cooling, low material budget, and large data volumes.\r\nI will report on the current status and new development of such detectors for high energy physics.\r\nIn particular, I will discuss the proposal of the CMS Collaboration to instrument the CMS detector with a timing layer to measure MIPs during the High-Luminosity LHC data taking period. The high pseudorapidity region (1.6 < |eta| < 3.0) of the CMS detector will be instrumented with a hermetic layer of LGAD. This installation will represent the first large scale application of the LGAD in a high energy physics experiment.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		824	2

218	CMS luminosity measurement for the 2018 data-taking period at sqrt(s) =13 TeV	Maximally precise calibration of the CMS luminosity measurement is critical for many physics measurements. To guarantee high quality absolute calibration, a complete van der Meer scan program was carried out at the CMS experiment in 2018. The systematic uncertainty on the absolute calibration from the van der Meer scans is derived with a precision of 2.1%. The performance and stability of the CMS luminometers is also evaluated using emittance scans taken throughout the course of the year, which allows for independent nonlinearity measurements and correction for each luminometer. Cross-detector stability and linearity, together with the normalization uncertainty from the van der Meer scans, results in a total luminosity uncertainty of 2.5%. The dominant systematic uncertainty arises from the x-y correlations of the beam shape, with other major contributions from stability and nonlinearity effects.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		818	2
219	Calibration and performance of the CMS pixel detector in LHC Run 2	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of two general-purpose detectors that reconstruct the products of high energy particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The silicon pixel detector is the innermost component of the CMS tracking system. It determines the trajectories of charged particles originating from the interaction region with high resolution enabling precise momentum and impact parameter measurements in the tracker. It is designed to operate in the high particle density environment of the LHC. The calibration of the pixel detector plays an important role in its performance. The calibration constants follow the physical changes in the sensors that are mostly induced by irradiation. These constants are regularly updated, maintained in a calibration database and used for the event reconstruction. In this poster we will present details on the offline calibration procedures and their effects on detector performance during the Run 2 period of LHC.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		818	2

221	Search for a pair production of dark photons via the Higgs portal at CMS 	The Standard Model (SM) is known to be incomplete, it fails at explaining the nature of the cosmological observed dark matter.  The introduction of a Dark Sector via an additional U(1)d gauge symmetry added to the SM Lagrangian provides a mechanism to introduce much needed new physics without perturbing the agreement between SM theoretical description and the Electroweak Precision Observables. The breaking of a new U(1)d symmetry gives rise to a massive dark photon, this dark photon can couple to SM particles via a small kinetic mixing parameter (epsilon).  In this talk we review a search for a pair production of dark photons in a final state with 4 muons, with a dataset of 35.9fb-1 collected by CMS during 2016, methods to estimate SM background and observed experimental limits are presented, such limits in the 2D plane defined by epsilon and the mass of the dark photon cover an unexplored area.   The plans to extend the search for an updated analysis with the whole Run-2 CMS dataset are discussed. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		818	2

234	Relative nonlinearity of BRIL luminometers derived from CMS mu-scans	For precise calibration of luminosity measurements, it is necessary to understand nonlinear effects which affect the single bunch instantaneous luminosity (SBIL) measured by a luminometer. The CMS BRIL group uses data from the hadronic forward (HF) calorimeter, the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT), and the Fast Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM1F) to measure the luminosity. A "mu scan" is a beam scan performed at specific conditions suitable for evaluating the luminometer linearity. During the scan the beam separation is varied so as to produce a resulting SBIL in the range 1–10 Hz/μb. Then, the analysis of luminometer linearity is carried out with respect to HFOC (HF using occupancy method for luminosity calibration). HFOC is considered to have the best linearity, so it is used as a reference scale. Also, a cross-check using the pixel cluster counting (PCC) method is used when PCC data is available. In this report, the summary of 2018 mu scans is presented, and the influence of nonlinear terms in measurements of luminosity is analyzed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		818	2
235	Boosting the CMS computing efficiency for data taking at higher luminosities	Thousands of physicists continuously analyze data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using the CMS Remote Analysis Builder (CRAB) and the CMS global pool to exploit the resources of the World LHC Computing Grid. Efficient use of such an extensive and expensive system is crucial and the previous design needs to be upgraded for the next data taking at unprecedented luminosities. \r\nSupporting varied workflows while preserving efficient resource usage poses special challenges:\r\n - scheduling of jobs in a multicore/pilot model where several single core jobs with an undefined runtime run inside pilot jobs with a fixed lifetime;\r\n - avoiding that too many concurrent reads from same storage push jobs into I/O wait mode making CPU cycles go idle;\r\n - monitor user activity to detect low-efficiency workflows and automatically provide them with advices for a smarter usage of the resources tailored on the use case.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		823	2

237	The Tracker Endcap Pixel detector for CMS phase II upgrade	After the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC), the instantaneous luminosity will increase to unprecedented values of 5-7x10^34cm-2s-1. In order to cope with these conditions the whole CMS silicon tracker detector will be replaced. This presentation describes the upgrade of the inner pixel system. The new inner pixel detector will be composed of three sub-detectors: the barrel detector (TBPX) consisting of four concentric cylindrical layers, the forward detector (TFPX) consisting of eight small disks on each side, and the endcap detector (TEPX) with four large disks on each side. Each of these systems will cover a different region in pseudorapidity, with TEPX extending the coverage up to |eta|<4.0. The upgraded detector will feature a new readout chip and sensor design, with a pixel area six times smaller than the present one. Furthermore, the services will be redesigned for the new system. In this contribution the new TEPX detector will be presented, with particular focus on the new layout, services, and physic performance of the system.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		818	2

243	Simulation studies of the impact of the CMS radiation environment on RPC detectors	The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) upgrade aims to increase its luminosity by a factor of 5 beyond the LHC’s design value and the integrated luminosity by a factor of 10, increasing the potential for discoveries after 2025. The increased collision rate of particles will be a challenge for the CMS systems as higher levels of radiation could degrade them and affect their performance. It is therefore important to understand the expected radiation environment and its impact on the different sub-detectors.  In this study we use the FLUKA simulation to reproduce the radiation environment during CMS Run-2 and the GEANT4 simulation to estimate its impact on the RPC detectors. Results are compared with measurements collected by the RPC system during 2018 and reasonable agreement is observed. This study serves as a benchmark for future simulations with a Phase-2 (HL-LHC) configuration. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		818	2

290	HTCondor Solutions for the Future of the CMS Submission Infrastructure	The resource landscape for high energy physics experiments in the HL-LHC era is expected to be more dominated by Cloud and HPC rather than traditional Grid sites, reaching scales much higher than current capacity. HPC and Cloud resources are much more diverse and heterogeneous than traditional Grid resources, each with special capabilities or limitations that must be handled by the submission infrastructure. The CMS experiment at the LHC at CERN is actively focusing on the functionality necessary to adapt the HTCondor infrastructure to fulfil these needs and requirements, with enhanced customization and control over resource allocation and usage while maintaining global flexibility. The stability and scalability of HTCondor pools to HL-LHC scales is thought to be tractable, with the increasing complexity of the pool architecture driving limitations.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		819	2

The analyses are optimised for high sensitivity over a large range in resonance mass. Jet substructure techniques are used to identify hadronic decays of highly-boosted W, Z, and H bosons.

313	Results on Bose-Einstein correlations of charged hadrons in pp collisions at 13 TeV	Femtoscopic correlations between charged hadrons are measured over a broad multiplicity range, from a few particles up to about 250 reconstructed charged hadrons, in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The results are based on data collected using the CMS detector at the LHC in 2015, during runs with a special low pileup configuration. Three analysis techniques with different dependencies on simulations are used to remove the non-Bose-Einstein background from the correlation functions, and are found to give consistent results. One-dimensional studies of the lengths-of-homogeneity, R_{inv}, and the intercept parameter, lambda, have been carried out for both inclusive events and high-multiplicity events selected using a dedicated online trigger. The measured lengths of homogeneity are studied as functions of particle multiplicity, pair average transverse momentum, and pair transverse mass. The results are compared with those from CMS collected at lower center-of-mass energies and to data from other LHC experiment, as well as with theoretical expectations from the color glass condensate and from hydrodynamical models. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		831	2

During the last year a large variety of test results have been achieved on different sensors connected to RD53A. The talk will summarise the results with focus on the system powering, the radiation hardness and the hit processing efficiency in the extremely high hit-rate environment.

323	Upsilon production vs charged particles multiplicity	The ratios of the production cross sections of the Upsilon(nS) mesons are studied using a sample of pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb−1, collected with the CMS detector at LHC. The ratios are measured for Upsilon(nS) as a function of the number of charged tracks. Evidence of a decrease of the ratios between the higher and the lower mass states as a function of the particles’ multiplicity is observed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		837	2

352	Photon detection with the CMS ECAL in the present and at the HL-LHC and its impact on Higgs boson measurements	The CMS experiment at the LHC features a high-resolution homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). Its excellent performance in the reconstruction of high-energy photons has played a key role in the discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its properties. The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-\r\nLHC) is expected to deliver an integrated luminosity 20 times larger than the LHC, allowing to study rare processes such as Higgs boson pair production and self-coupling. During HL-LHC operations, up to 200 concurrent interactions per-bunch collision are expected. In order to maintain its current performance\r\nin the harsher environment of the HL-LHC, an upgrade of the ECAL is planned. This contribution describes the ECAL performance in photon reconstruction and its impact on the measurement of the Higgs boson properties during the LHC Run II. Prospects for Higgs boson measurements at the HL-LHC are presented as well.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		832	2

363	(YSF) Higgs production at Run 2 and projections for the HL-LHC with the CMS phase-2 detector	The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is expected to deliver an integrated luminosity of up to 3000 fb-1. The large number of events expected for Higgs boson properties will allow very precise measurements of its properties, being the expected overall statistical, experimental and theoretical uncertainties comparable in size. However, the very high instantaneous luminosity will lead to about 200 proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing ("pileup") superimposed to each event of interest. To cope with this extremely challenging experimental environment, an upgrade of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is foreseen. This will allow to reach a precision timing of about 30ps that will guarantee a substantially improved pile-up mitigation and better event reconstruction. After a summary of present search results from Run 2, CMS prospects on Higgs self-coupling measurements and HH production at the HL-LHC are presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		828	2

The crystal energy reconstruction algorithms and clustering techniques, developed to maintain the excellent performance of the CMS ECAL throughout Run II, are presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		828	2

369	Large rapidity gap between jets in p-p collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with CMS	We study events with dijets separated by a large rapidity gap, known as jet-gap-jet events. The rapidity gap signature is consistent with an underlying hard color-singlet exchange. The analysis is based on an inclusive dijet data sample collected in p-p collisions in a dedicated low luminosity run during 2015 at 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 0.66 pb$^{-1}$. We use the charged particle multiplicity in the fixed pseudorapidity region $-1 < \\eta <  1$ to isolate the color-singlet exchange dijet signal events from color-exchange dijet events. We measure the ratio of color-singlet exchange dijet events to inclusive dijet events as a function of the pseudorapidity difference between the leading two jets, transverse momentum of the subleading jet and the azimuthal angle separation between the leading two jets. These observables are sensitive to predictions by perturbative quantum chromodynamics described by the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov evolution equations. Our results do not depend on Monte Carlo event simulations or other model-dependent assumptions.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		829	2

Recent differential measurements of single top quark production cross sections are presented using data collected by CMS at 13 TeV. The cross sections are measured as a function of various kinematic observables of the top quarks and the jets and leptons of the events in the final state. The results are confronted with precise theory calculations.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		828	2
372	Application of Adversarial Networks in search for four top quark production in CMS	One burden of High Energy Physics data analysis is uncertainty within the measurement, both systematically and statistically. Even with sophisticated neural network techniques that are used to assist in High Energy Physics measurement, the resulting measurement still suffers from both types of uncertainties. Fortunately, most types of systematic uncertainties are based on knowledge from information such as theoretical assumptions, for which the range and behaviour is known. It has been proposed to mitigate such systematic uncertainties by using a new type of neural network called adversarial neural network (ANN), but this has not been shown to work in a real-life LHC analysis. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		840	2
373	Scintillator Tiles for the High Granularity Calorimeter of the CMS Detector at the HL-LHC	The CMS Phase II upgrade, High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCal) will have fine transverse and longitudinal segmentation to allow for superior particle identification and pileup rejection in the high radiation and large event pileup environment of the endcap region. A significant portion of the hadronic portion of the HGCal will be instrumented with scintillator tiles directly coupled to Silicon Photomultiplers.

375	Search for Supersymmetry at CMS in Events with Large Jet Multiplicity and Low Missing Transverse Momentum at sqrt(s)=13 TeV 	In traditional searches for physics beyond the standard model, a requirement of high missing transverse momentum (MET) is often used. However, without any signs of significant deviations from the standard model expectations, we decided to relax this requirement for the search reported in this talk. Many new physics models, including versions of supersymmetry (SUSY) characterized by R-parity violation, compressed mass spectra, long decay chains, or with additional hidden sectors predict the production of events with low MET, many jets, and top quarks. The results of a general search for new physics featuring two top quarks and six additional light flavor jets are reported. The search is performed using events with at least seven jets and exactly one electron or muon. No requirement on MET is imposed. With the use of a neural-network-based signal-to-background discriminator, a background estimation was achieved where more traditional techniques was not an option. The study is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV corresponding to 77.4 fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and 2017. Results of the search are interpreted for pair production of scalar top quarks in the frameworks of stealth SUSY and SUSY with R-parity violation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		841	2

This is particularly important to study many physics processes with muons in the final state. The CMS GEM chambers will cover eta region 1.6 to 2.2 of the endcap. We report on the GE1/1 layout and their performance studies estimated during the R&D and beam tests at CERN.

378	Search for dark photons with CMS and fixed-target experiments 	Searches for dark matter in the past two decades have largely focused on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). But what if instead of just one type of dark matter particle, there exists a richer dark sector hidden from ordinary view? This opens up a whole new paradigm for dark matter searches, allowing us to focus not only on the coupling between dark matter and the Standard Model, but also on the interactions between dark sector constituents themselves. In this talk, I describe two complementary approaches to this new kind of dark matter program: (1) PADME, a fixed-target, missing-mass experiment seeking evidence for the dark photon, a hypothetical mediator of a new U(1) gauge symmetry in the dark sector; and (2) a search for inelastic dark matter (iDM) with a unique signature in the CMS detector, using dark photons as DM-SM mediators. The complementarity of these two methods is explored, both in terms of accessible parameter space and experimental challenges.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		841	2

400	Review of the ttH results and prospects from CMS	The Higgs boson mass and couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons were measured early after its discovery during LHC Run I. Sensitivity to the Higgs couplings to fermions however has required the large amount of data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during LHC Run II. Recent measurements of the Higgs boson couplings to tau leptons as well as top and bottom quarks mark crucial steps in understanding the mechanism of fermion-mass generation. In this presentation, the latest measurements of the associated production of a Higgs boson and a top quark-antiquark pair (ttH production) performed with the CMS experiment will be reviewed. The ttH production channel provides a direct probe of the coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark and is instrumental in testing the Standard Model and constraining various potential new physics models.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		843	2

405	Phase2 endcap calorimeter (HGCAL) 	The CMS experiment at CERN will undergo significant improvements to cope with a 5-fold increase in instantaneous luminosity for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) era. In particular the endcap calorimetry will suffer from very high radiation levels and unprecedented event pileup. The CMS HGCAL is being designed to replace the existing CMS endcap electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. It will be a sampling calorimeter, featuring unprecedented transverse and longitudinal readout and trigger segmentation for both electromagnetic (CE-E) and hadronic (CE-H) compartments. This will facilitate particle-flow calorimetry, where the fine structure of showers can be measured and used to enhance pileup rejection and particle identification, whilst still achieving good energy resolution. The CE-E and a large fraction of CE-H will use hexagonal silicon sensors as active detector material. The lower-radiation environment will be instrumented with scintillator tiles with on-tile SiPM readout. An overview of the HGCAL project will be presented, covering motivation, engineering design, readout and trigger concepts, and performance in beams and in simulation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		843	2

412	A semi-empirical model for pre-heater design in module cooling	The CMS Tracker CO2 cooling system is presently being designed for the Phase II upgrade. At the inlet of the on-detector evaporators, the superheating phenomenon may occur before evaporation can start. Superheating needs to be avoided, since in these conditions the heat exchange is extremely poor, due to the single phase heat exchange pattern (no boiling) and the higher CO2 temperature reached. Transition to two-phase CO2 could be facilitated using pre-heaters: concentrated heat sources positioned before the modules and aimed at triggering the formation of bubbles. The design of these components represents quite a challenge, as it is linked to many influential parameters such as: pipe material and geometry, CO2 flow rate and thermophysical conditions, pre-heater power and geometry. The experimental approach constitutes the best way forward, but a large number of tests is needed to cover all boundary conditions. A semi-empirical model for the pre-heater design is proposed: starting from a few experimental data points, the model allows complete characterisation of a pipe made of a specific material and production process, giving the possibility to design the pre-heater for that type of pipe while changing any boundary condition (flow, power, length). The model is based on the definition of the conditions for the onset of nucleate boiling on the pipe walls: for nucleation to occur on a pipe wall, the entire liquid-vapour interface of a bubble should be at a temperature above the minimum liquid superheat requirement for the bubble itself. Since the temperature in the liquid reduces farther away from the pipe surface, the lowest temperature in the liquid is experienced in the tip of the growing bubble. A simple condition is thus derived when the liquid temperature at the tip exceeds the minimum required temperature to sustain the vapour bubble, deriving the liquid temperature profile from the ducts turbulent flow analysis. This procedure gives the definitions of a minimum and a maximum radius of active cavities that allow the onset of nucleate boiling. As it is generally difficult to assess what is the microscopic structure of pipes, in order to understand if the pipe surface contains cavities that are suitable to generate nucleate bubbles, experimental data is needed. For each type of pipe to be studied, an experimental test has to be prepared in order to tune the model. The test aims to characterize the pipe under well-controlled conditions of heat flux and CO2 mass flow, in order to obtain the cavity radii range for the surface of the pipe under investigation. As a consequence, different configurations for this duct can now be modelled, with no further need of testing, as the onset nucleate boiling condition is uniquely defined by the cavity radii. The semi-empirical approach (theoretical mixed with tests, as an experimental calibration is needed) previously illustrated went through an initial validation process at CERN. The model itself seems to correctly predict the impact of changing the design of the pre-heaters, catching the expected variations of their nominal power with respect to some of the parameters involved, such as the pre-heater length, the liquid CO2 temperature and its mass flow rate. A more extensive validation campaign is needed, to analyse the model behaviour when other influential variables are changed: pipe diameter, subcooling level, and pipe roughness, with the latter playing a role that seems particularly important.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		849	2

414	Studies of the top quark production in nuclear collisions and impact on nuclear PDFs in CMS	In proton-nucleus collisions, the top quark is a novel and theoretically precise probe of the nuclear gluon density at high virtualities $Q^2\\approx m_{\\mathrm{top}}$ and in the less explored high Bjorken-$x$ region. The first observation of the inclusive $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ production has been performed using 174$\\pm$6 $\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ of data in pPb collisions at $\\sqrt{\\smash [b]{s_{_{\\mathrm {NN}}}}}=8.16$ TeV. However, the total uncertainty of about 17% is not sufficient for imposing constraints on current nPDF parameterizations, the dominant source of uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of $\\sigma(\\mathrm{pPb}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}} + X)$. The prospects of measuring $\\sigma$ differentially have recently been examined and a feasibility study of the  measurement with the CMS detector at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) era is therefore carried out as a function of the reconstructed lepton $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and rapidity. The relative statistical uncertainty in both variables is found to be at the level of 4$-$5% in each bin, and it is expected to be the dominant uncertainty at $\\sqrt{\\smash [b]{s_{_{\\mathrm {NN}}}}}=8.16$ TeV for an integrated luminosity scenario of 2 $\\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$. The motivations for measurements of top quarks in nucleus-nucleus collisions are multifold and are discussed: the top quark decay products are sensitive to the energy loss of heavy quarks, and a probe of the space-time structure of the QGP at HL-LHC.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		850	2

422	Searching for Dark Matter with Semi-Visible Jets at CMS	Most theories that predict dark matter production at colliders rely on weakly coupled dark matter and the existence of WIMPs, or weakly interacting massive particles; however, there can be dark matter signatures in colliders that emerge from strongly coupled dark matter. These signatures are varied, ranging from emerging jets to Stealth Dark Matter. Another possible signature is semi-visible jets. These occur if the dark sector is comprised of a strong-like structure with dark hadrons made up of dark quarks. Once produced, a heavy dark quark would then hadronize into stable dark "pions", which leave the detector as dark matter, and unstable dark hadrons that shower and appear as SM hadronic showers. Since the true jet is made up of visible SM quarks and missing transverse energy closely aligned with the shower, the jet is called semi-visible. This presentation will discuss a Hidden Valley theory that results in such a signature, as well as a work-in-progress analysis by members of the CMS Collaboration trying to find this signature.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		841	2

427	Upsilon(nS) production vs charged particle multiplicity in pp collision at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV	The ratios of the production cross sections of the Upsilon(nS) mesons are studied using a sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb−1, collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The ratios are measured for Upsilon(nS) rapidity |y| < 1.2 as a function of the number of charged tracks with transverse momentum pT > 0.4 GeV and pseudorapidity |eta| < 2.4. Evidence of a decrease of the ratios between the higher and the lower mass states as a function of the particles’ multiplicity is observed, which is more pronounced at lower Upsilon(nS) pT. For Upsilon(nS) mesons of transverse momenta greater than 7 GeV, this effect is studied as a function of the underlying event transverse sphericity, and of the angular distribution of the charged particles with respect to the Upsilon(nS) direction.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		853	2

High-precision measurement of B mesons will shed light on our knowledge of flavour-dependence of in-medium energy loss. Using the large statistics PbPb data collected in 2018, measurements of $B^{+}$ meson in unprecedented precision have been performed with the CMS detector.

431	Measurement of b+jet shapes in sqrt(s)=5.02 TeV pp collisions with CMS	Heavy flavor parton studies through corresponding final state jets are essential to an understanding of the strong interactions that define QCD as they occur in vacuum. Furthermore, measuring the properties for a jet originating from beauty or producing a beauty quark pair during fragmentation in vacuum defines an experimental baseline against which the physics of heavy flavor jet production in the hot, dense medium produced in energetic collisions of heavy ions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). In this talk we will present the first b-jet shapes measurement at sqrt(s) = 5 TeV  in pp with data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Heavy flavor jet shapes are compared to the corresponding shapes for inclusive jets and the modifications due to flavor are quantified.

436	Bottomonium production in pp, pPb and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector	Measurements of bottomonium production are reported for the $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(2S), and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ mesons in pp, pPb and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV. The analysis was performed as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum. In addition, the dependence on the event activity and collision centrality is studied in pPb and PbPb collisions, respectively. New results of the upsilon production in pPb collisions will be presented, compared with the results from PbPb collisions. In this presentation, the results are discussed in terms of the ‘cold nuclear matter’ effects in pPb collisions and sequential melting scenario in dense partonic matter, as well as the effect from recombination of uncorrelated quarks. The results are also compared with theory models, which can help to improve and constrain the theoretical calculations. Finally, the ratios of the production cross sections of the Upsilon(nS) mesons are studied using a sample of proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb$^{-1}$. The ratios are measured for Upsilon(nS) rapidity $|y| < 1.2$ as a function of the number of charged tracks with transverse momentum $p_{T} > 0.4$ GeV and pseudorapidity $|\\eta| < 2.4$. Evidence of a decrease of the ratios between the higher and the lower mass states as a function of the particles’ multiplicity is observed, which is more pronounced at lower $\\Upsilon(nS)$ $p_{T}$. For $\\Upsilon(nS)$ mesons of transverse momenta greater than 7 GeV, this effect is studied as a function of the underlying event transverse sphericity, and of the angular distribution of the charged particles with respect to the $\\Upsilon(nS)$ direction.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		853	2
437	Strange and non-strange charm production in pp and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector	The heavy-flavour particles are produced in the earlier stage in heavy-ion collision and experience the full evolution of the QGP medium. The measurement of D mesons could provide us important inputs for flavour and charge dependent transport properties. On the other hand, with abundant strange quarks presented in heavy-ion collision, the $D_{S}^{+}$ production is expected to be enhanced hadronization via recombination. Large statistics proton-proton and PbPb samples collected at 5.02 TeV with CMS detector are used for the measurement of $D^{0}$ and $D_{S}^{+}$ production over a wide transverse momentum range. Result of D-meson $p_T$-differential cross section, nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, and the ratio of $D_{S}^{+}$ over $D^{0}$ for both pp and PbPb collisions are presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		853	2
438	D-meson production in jets in pp and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector	The measurement of D-meson production in jets can provide important insights into the interactions of heavy-flavour quarks with the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions. In particular, the role of gluon splitting processes in the production of heavy flavour, which is fundamental for a complete understanding of the quenching mechanisms for both light and heavy quarks, can be explored. Large datasets for proton-proton and PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV were collected with the CMS detector during the 2015 LHC run. These data enable measurements of D-meson production as a function of the radial distance between the jet axis and the D meson in different intervals of D-meson transverse momentum. The ratio of the results for PbPb and pp collisions will be compared to similar measurements of jet radial profiles using light particles from the CMS experiment at the same center-of-mass energy.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		853	2
439	$Lambda_{C}$ production in pp and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector	Due to their large masses, the interactions of heavy quarks with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) may be different from those of light quarks. The lightest charm baryon is the $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$, composed of a charm quark and two light quarks. Measurements of $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ production in both pp and PbPb collisions can provide important inputs to the understanding of heavy quark transport in the QGP and the creation of heavy quark mesons and baryons via coalescence. Models involving quark coalescence predict a large enhancement of $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ production in PbPb collisions compared to pp collisions. The high luminosity datasets collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV using the CMS detector have been used to measure $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ production in both pp and PbPb collisions via the $\\Lambda_{c}^{+} \\to p^{+} K^{-} \\pi^{+}$ decay channel. Results for differential cross sections for $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and ratios of $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ over $D^{0}$ yields in pp and PbPb collisions, as well as the nuclear modification factors for $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$, are presented. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		853	2

This measurement provides important information for models related to the initial state in pPb collisions, and can also be used to tune Monte Carlo event generators of cosmic ray physics. In addition, recent results on exclusive vector meson photoproduction of Rho0, J/psi and Upsilon in both pPb and PbPb collisions will be presented.

443	Measurements of strange and non-strange beauty production in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector	Beauty quarks are considered to be one of the golden probes of the strong interacting medium created in heavy-ion collisions as they are mainly produced via initial hard scatterings and strongly interact with the medium. They are sensitive to the transport properties of the medium and may interact with the QCD matter differently from light quarks. High-precision measurement of B mesons will shed light on our knowledge of flavour-dependence of in-medium energy loss. In addition, the measurements of the production of strange and non-strange beauty mesons provides fundamental insights into relevance of mechanisms of beauty recombination in the quark-gluon plasma.  Using the large statistics PbPb data collected in 2018, measurements of $B_{S}^{0}$ and $B^{+}$ have been performed with the CMS detector. In this talk, we will present the ratio of production yield between $B_{S}^{0}$ and $B^{+}$ in PbPb collisions with full hadronic reconstruction. The result will be compared with the same observable measured in pp collisions and we will also discuss the comparison with several theoretical predictions. We will also present the latest measurements of production of fully reconstructed $B^{+}$ and non-prompt $D^{0}$ and $J/\\psi$ from b decay in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		853	2
444	Contraining nPDFs with electroweak boson measurements in pPb collisions with CMS	Nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) of quarks and antiquarks affect the production electroweak bosons in proton-lead (pPb) collision. In this presentation the measurement of W and Z bosons in pPb collision at center of mass energies of 5.02 TeV and 8.16 TeV with CMS is presented. The rapidity dependence is particularly sensitive to nPDFs, but further information can be gained by studying the mass dependence of DY production, measured for the first time in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV, down to 15 GeV. In addition, differential measurements in the dimuon pt or $\\phi^{*}$ (an angular variable correlated with pt, measured for the first time in pPb) provide insights on soft gluon emission at low pt. Comparisons to theory calculations show that these data are sensitive to the presence of nuclear modifications to the parton distributions in the lead nucleus, and can help improve and constrain theoretical calculations. Finally, prospects on Z boson production with future HL-LHC data are presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		850	2

446	Measurements of nuclear parton distribution functions using dijets, forward jets, and photo-nuclear jets at the CMS detector & prospects for measurements in Run III 	Measurements of dijet production and photo-nuclear interactions in heavy-ion collisions probe several nuclear mechanisms. In particular, dijet measurements in pPb collisions have been shown to be one of the most important tools for constraining the gluon nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs) at large Bjorken-x. Dijet production in pp and pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV is reported with the data samples collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The dijet pseudorapidity distributions are measured as a function of dijet average transverse momentum in order to study the nuclear modifications of PDFs at various factorization scales. The final results from pp and pPb data samples are compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions obtained from both nucleon and nuclear PDFs. A significant modification of dijet pseudorapidity distributions in pPb collisions with respect to the measured pp reference is observed which indicates that the gluon PDF in lead ions is modified and the results are incompatible with predictions with DSSZ PDF without gluon EMC effects. Photo-nuclear jets are also measured in pp and pPb collision systems.

449	Assembly and integration of the CMS Phase-2 Outer Tracker Endcap	For the High-Luminosity LHC, CMS will install a completely new silicon tracker. Due to the anticipated increase in instantaneous luminosity by a factor of five compared to the LHC design value, the granularity will be significantly increased in order to cope with the higher track density. The future tracker will consist of two barrel parts and two endcaps (TEDD), one on each side. One TEDD is made of five double-disks, each equipped with detector modules on all four faces to ensure a complete coverage. The backbone of the mechanical structure of the end caps are highly integrated half-disks (Dees). After the Dees are equipped with modules and tested, they are combined to form disks, double-disks and finally the TEDD. With the Dees being lightweight but large and fragile objects, they need to be supported during assembly and integration. A large semi circular arc frame is being designed to support the detector parts during all necessary integration steps, which includes transport, thermal cycling and relative positioning to a high precision. For the integration, tooling to precisely align the different disks is needed before installing the connecting skeleton. Dedicated assembly stations are being designed to allow sub mm precision alignment. The contribution will give an introduction into the design of the TEDD and the half-disks, and discuss the plan for an assembly sequence. The designs and prototypes for toolings to build double-disks and the final TEDD will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		849	2

453	New opportunities in heavy ion physics at HL-LHC with a MIP Timing Detector at CMS	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is undergoing an extensive Phase II upgrade program to prepare for the challenging conditions of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A new timing layer is designed to measure minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with a time resolution of ~30ps and hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |eta|=3. The precision time information from the CMS MIP timing detector (MTD) will serve as an excellent time-of-flight detector for particle identification in QCD and heavy ion physics. Together with the wide coverage of tracker and calorimetry, the MTD will enable new and unique opportunities of heavy ion physics at CMS.

454	Heat Extraction through Structural Components of the CMS Phase II Tracker Forward Pixel Detector	The High Luminosity LHC will reach an instantaneous luminosity of 5 x 10^34 cm^-2 s^-1 with 140 to 200 pp collisions per bunch crossing and collect a total of 3 ab^-1 of 14 TeV data. To cope with these challenging data conditions, the CMS Inner Tracker will be rebuilt for Phase II Upgrades. To limit particle occupancy to the per mille level and improve track resolution, we will increase the granularity of the sensors. This will result in power dissipation of approximately 60 kW. For sensors to survive the radiation close to the beam pipe, we will need to maintain them around -20 C. Thus, cooling the detector will be of paramount importance and structural components will also serve to extract heat. We present thermal transport property measurements of these structural materials using novel, custom-made apparatuses. These measurements inform finite element analysis simulations that point to potential heat transfer bottlenecks that can lead to thermal run-away in the sensors and their readout chips. To improve one of the bottlenecks, we investigate the variation of thermal conductivity of an adhesive by loading it with various compounds at varying concentrations. We also present measurements of thermal conductivity of these structural materials after irradiation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		849	2

The muon decay channel is used to study both positive and negative W bosons as a function of muon pseudorapidity. Rapidity and charge asymmetries in the W yield are studied. Comparisons to theory calculations show that these data are sensitive to the presence of nuclear modifications to the parton distributions in the lead nucleus, and can help improve and constrain theoretical calculations.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		850	2
456	Design, Simulation, Manufacturing, and Validation of Prototype CMS Phase II Inner Tracker Service Cylinder	The primary support structure for CMS Phase II Inner Tracker detectors, known as the service cylinder, has been through its first iteration of prototyping at Purdue University’s Composites Manufacturing and Simulation Center (CMSC) and Purdue Silicon Detector Lab (PSDL). The mass, stiffness, and dimensional tolerance were the primary design objectives. In order to meet the extreme mechanical performance and dimensional stability requirements, a stiff yet lightweight carbon fiber composite structure has been designed via performance and manufacturing simulations, manufactured as a prototype, and validated. Several layups and configurations of structural stiffeners were investigated to minimize the deflection of the service cylinder within the permissible design envelope. Design iterations and simulation results demonstrate the diminishing returns of increased mass vs structural rigidity under the defined load cases that include the weight of the detectors and services. The importance of performing tool shape compensation to account for anisotropic material coefficients of thermal expansion and their effect on part geometry during and after manufacturing is explored and implemented. Validation exercises with digital image correlation (DIC) fiducial marker tracking emphasize the importance of designing simple, yet meaningful, test load cases that allow validation of FEA methodology. Good agreement was found between the simulation and the experiment, however further validation efforts are ongoing. With FEA methodology and boundary conditions validated for simplified load cases, more accurate load case simulations may be trusted for continuing design work until an assembled prototype allows for “full-scale” validation. Lessons learned during design, simulation, manufacturing, and validation are presented with a set of next steps to improve upon each for the creation of a successful service cylinder that meets final application requirements.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		849	2

458	Thermal finite element analyses of the CMS Phase II Tracker Forward Pixel detector	Thermal finite element analyses (FEA) of representative and realistic structures in the CMS Phase II Tracker Forward Pixel detector are presented. The high granularity of the sensors and associated readout electronics (modules) necessary to take data at the High Luminosity LHC will generate 60 kW of heat that needs to be extracted for the sensors to be maintained around -20C. The FEA of representative structures for the module mounts serve to identify thermal bottlenecks in transporting heat from the modules to the mixed phase carbon dioxide cooling pipes. Using the representative structure, we explore various candidate geometries and materials to optimize the heat transfer. The FEA of realistic structures are used to estimate the temperature profile within the detector for optimal running and failure modes of the readout chips to anticipate, and thus avoid, thermal runaways in the real detector.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		849	2

Furthermore, the constraints on the parton distribution functions of the proton can be probed by including the measurements of these processes in a QCD analysis.

469	Beyond-Standard-Model Physics at the High-Luminosity LHC with the CMS detector	The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is expected to deliver an integrated luminosity of up to 3000 fb-1. The very high instantaneous luminosity will lead to about 200 proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing (“pileup”) superimposed to each event of interest, therefore providing extremely challenging experimental conditions. The sensitivity to find new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics is significantly improved and will allow extending the reach for heavy vector bosons, for BSM Higgs, SUSY, dark matter and exotic long-lived signatures, to name a few.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
460	Study of Jet Fragmentation in J/Psi and D mesons with CMS	Two measurements of J/psi and D mesons production in conjunction with jets are reported. The first analysis is based on pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.1 fb−1. The differential distributions of jet fragmentation probability as a function of jet energy for a fixed J/psi energy fraction z are compared to a theoretical model based on the fragmenting jet function (FJF) approach. These data distingush clearly between different nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) long distance matrix element (LDME) parameter sets and also between different  NRQCD terms. The data show that for the z range from 0.40 to 0.65, the NRQCD 1S(8) term dominates jet fragmentation to J/psi mesons 0 for one LDME parameter set. The second analysis is based on PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV collected with the CMS detector during the 2015 LHC run. These data enable measurements of D-meson production as a function of the radial distance between the jet axis and the D meson in different intervals of D-meson transverse momentum. The ratio of the results for PbPb and pp collisions are compared to similar measurements of jet radial profiles using light particles from the CMS experiment at the same center-of-mass energy.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		853	2

463	CHROMIE: a new High-rate telescope. Detector simulation and commissioning	The upgrade of the LHC to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is expected to increase the current instantaneous luminosity by a factor of 5 to 7, providing the opportunity to study rare processes and precision measurement of the standard model parameters. To cope with the increase in pile-up (up to 200), particle density and radiation, CMS will build new silicon tracking devices with higher granularity (to reduce occupancy) and improved radiation hardness.\r\nDuring the R&D period, tests performed under beam are a powerful way to develop and examine the behavior of silicon sensors in realistic conditions. The telescopes used up to now have a slow readout (< 10 kHz) for the needs of the CMS experiment, since the new outer-tracker modules have an effective return-to-zero time of 25 ns (corresponding to a 40 MHz frequency) and a trigger rate of 750 kHz.\r\nIn order to test the CMS Tracker modules under the LHC nominal rate, a new pixel telescope named CHROMIE (CMS High Rate telescOpe MachInE) was designed, built and commissioned at CERN for beam tests with prototype modules for the CMS Phase-II Tracker upgrade. It is based on 16 CMS Phase-I Barrel Pixel modules of the same type as the ones used in the current CMS pixel detector. In this talk, the design of CHROMIE, the calibration of its modules, and its timing and synchronization aspects are presented, along with the first beam test results. In addition, the tracking algorithm developed for CHROMIE and a preliminary simulation study for the estimation of energy loss of primary particles, cluster multiplicity and spatial resolution are discussed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		863	2
464	Track Reconstruction Performance with the CMS Detector during LHC Run 2	The CMS detector is one of two multi-purpose experiments at the CERN LHC, pursuing a rich physics program in a multitude of signatures. A key ingredient in the interpretation of the recorded data is the ability to reconstruct the trajectory of charged particles through the detector from hits in the silicon pixel and strip detectors that constitute the CMS inner tracker. The algorithms employed for this task have to efficiently reconstruct tracks from a few 100 MeV to several TeV, originating not only in the proton-proton interaction region but also from secondary vertices that can be significantly displaced. This challenge was further complicated due to the unprecedented number of additional proton-proton interactions (pileup) per bunch crossing during the data taking in the LHC Run 2.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

466	Radiation Aging studies of the CMS DT Muon Detector	During the operation of the HL-LHC (High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider) [1], the Drift Tube (DT) [2] muon chambers instrumenting the return yoke of the CMS experiment need to operate with an integrated dose ten times higher than the expected during the first phase of LHC, at a factor of five larger collision rate than so far achieved in operation. Irradiations have been performed to assess the performance of the detector under such conditions and to characterize the aging due to exposure to radiation. Here we present results for the DT chambers, which are wire gaseous detectors used to identify, reconstruct and trigger on muons.  Spare DT chambers were installed at the Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++) [3] at CERN and irradiated with a high activity Cessium 137 source over several month campaigns.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		868	2

468	CMS upgrade plan for high-luminosity era and outlook on heavy-quark production in nuclear collisions	The CMS Collaboration has a major detector upgrade plan during the long shutdown 3 (LS3) starting in 2019 to prepare the high-luminosity runs.

This upgrade will significantly enhance the physics performance of the CMS detector for not only proton-proton collisions, but also heavy-ion collisions in high-luminosity environment. In this presentation we, firstly, give an overview of the CMS upgrade plan during LS3.

477	Measurement of the ttbb production cross section in the all-jet final state with CMS	We present a measurement of the ttbb cross section, using data collected in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1.\r\nThe cross section is measured in the all-jet decay channel of the top quark pairs by selecting events containing at least eight jets, of which two are identified as b jets.\r\nA combination of multivariate analysis techniques is used to reduce the large background consisting uniquely of jets produced through the strong interaction, and to discriminate the jets originating from the top quark decays and additional jets.\r\nThe cross section is measured for the visible ttbb phase space, as well as for the full\r\nphase space.\r\nThe measured cross sections are compared with predictions of several event generators and are found to be generally higher than the theoretical predictions.\r\nThis measurement provides valuable input to studies of the ttH and four top quark processes, for which the normalisation and modelling of the ttbb process represents a leading source of systematic uncertainty. Furthermore, these results represent a stringent test for perturbative QCD predictions at the LHC.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

One of the most notable features of the Phase 2 CMS Tracker upgrade is a novel geometry with silicon detector modules in tilted orientation with respect to the beam line. Compared to traditional barrel/endcap geometries, this tilted concept provides clear advantages in terms of mass and cost saving, but poses unprecedented challenges on the mechanical design, integration and assembly procedures. Prototyping of the chosen tilted ‘Ring’ structures was launched in 2018.

482	 Measurement of the jet mass distribution in boosted top quark decays at CMS 	We present an unfolded measurement of the jet mass distribution in fully-merged hadronic decays of highly boosted top quarks. The measurement is performed in the lepton+jets channel in top quark pair production, using data recorded by the CMS detector in 2016 at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV. The boosted hadronic top quark decay is reconstructed using the XCone jet algorithm in a two step procedure. This results in a large jet from the fully-hadronic top quark decay, with exactly three XCone subjets. This method improves the jet mass resolution considerably compared to jets clustered with the anti-kt algorithm. The unfolded jet mass distribution shows sensitivity to the top quark mass.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		871	2
483	A new trigger algorithm for the upgrade of the CMS Drift Tube Detector at the HL-LHC	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a proton-proton collider which has been\r\ntaking data for almost a decade with a maximum energy in the center of mass of 13\r\nTeV and an instantaneous luminosity of up to 2×10 34 cm −2 s −1 . In order to increase\r\nits discovery reach, it will undergo an upgrade program that will allow increasing the\r\nintegrated luminosity by a factor 10. This will be the so-called High-Luminosity LHC\r\n(HL-LHC), which will start taking data after the Long Shutdown 3 (2024-2025).\r\nThe Drift Tube detector is one of the muon detectors of the CMS (Compact\r\nMuon Solenoid) experiment, and for HL-LHC, will need to replace its readout and\r\ntrigger electronics with a new system. The new on detector electronics will forward\r\nthe time digital information from the cell signals (hits) through an asynchronous\r\nlink at full resolution and with reduced dead time. The new backend system will\r\nreceive these time stamps and build the chamber trigger primitives exploiting the full\r\nresolution of the detector, targeting a performance closer to what it is done today in\r\nthe HLT (High Level Trigger) software system, improving the muon reconstruction.\r\nIn this paper we will show a new algorithm designed for the DT trigger system.\r\nThis algorithm is capable of receiving the asynchronous hits, which have a resolution\r\nof 1 ns (instead of present 12.5 ns), but an uncertainty of 400 ns due to the cell drift\r\ntime, and reconstruct the bunch crossing number where the muon was generated\r\nand obtain the position and angle of the track.\r\nTo study its performance, we have used real data samples from the CMS exper-\r\niment, filtered to contain mostly events with one Z boson decaying to two muons.\r\nThe data from this sample is corrected to represent Phase 2 electronics inputs and\r\nit is processed to emulate the trigger primitive algorithm. From studies in this data\r\nand in simulation we obtain results of around 95 % efficiency, less than 5 ns resolu-\r\ntion in the bunch crossing time computation, position resolutions of less than 0.15\r\nmm and slope resolution of less than 0.010 rad. These last two results are almost\r\n4 and 3 times better than the ones we have nowadays with the present system. In\r\naddition, this algorithm has been implemented in firmware and it is currently being\r\ntested for triggering in cosmic ray muons.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		868	2

Hadronically decaying top quarks are reconstructed as a wide jet with pT > 400 GeV. The cross sections are extracted differentially as a function of kinematic variables of the top quark or top quark pair system, and the results are presented at the fiducial detector level and unfolded to the particle and parton levels, and compared to various theoretical models. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		871	2

The latest CMS studies of jet substructure observables such as splitting function, groomed mass, boson-tagged fragmentation functions and jet shapes and their corresponding comparisons to theory give insight into the Quark Gluon Plasma, and how parton propagation is modified in QCD matter as opposed to matter.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		871	2

Furthermore, study of jet substructure properties in boosted topologies are critical for distinguishing jets originating from quarks, gluons, W/ Z/Higgs bosons, top quarks and pileup interactions. Lastly, the precise measurement of the missing transverse momentum (MET) observable is critical for standard model measurements involving W, Z, and the Higgs bosons, and top quarks. MET is also one of the most important kinematic observable used in searches for physics beyond the standard model targeting new weakly interacting neutral particles.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		871	2

517	A measurement of the top quark Yukawa coupling from differential cross sections of top quark pairs with CMS	A measurement of the top quark Yukawa coupling from the top quark-antiquark production as function of the mass of the top quark pair and the rapidity difference is presented. Corrections due to weak boson exchange, including the Higgs boson, between the top quarks can produce large distortions of differential distributions near the energy threshold of top quark pair production and at high invariant masses. Therefore, precise measurements of these distributions are sensitive to the Yukawa coupling.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

520	Search for anomalous triple gauge couplings in semileptonic WW and WZ decays with CMS	The LHC Run II with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has opened new doors for searching possible effects of physics beyond the standard model. New physics can be parametrized by the addition of higher dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian in the so called Effective Field Theory approach. In this poster we summarize an analysis which focuses on operators in the electroweak sector which lead to anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGC). The analysis deals with the WW/WZ final states in the semileptonic decay channel where boosted topology is used for the hadronic decay. We present 1-D and 2-D limits on aTGC parameters, with the limits being the most stringent experimental limits to date.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
521	Search for a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z or W boson, where H decays to b-bbar and the Z/W to leptons at CMS.	In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations announced the discovery of a new state with a mass around 125 GeV, compatible with the Standard Model Higgs boson. The measurements of this new particle’s properties are important to test the predictions of the Standard Model.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
522	Observation of single top quark production in association with a Z boson from CMS	The observation of single top quark production in association with a Z boson and a quark (tZq) is presented. Events from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV containing three charged leptons (either electrons or muons) and at least two jets are analyzed. The data were collected with the CMS detector in 2016 and 2017, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 77.4 fb−1. The increased integrated luminosity, a multivariate lepton identification, and a redesigned analysis strategy improve significantly the sensitivity of the analysis compared to previous searches for tZq production. The tZq signal is observed with a significance well over five standard deviations, and its production cross section is measured with an uncertainty more than twice smaller than that in any previous measurement.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
523	QCD couplings probed with top quark pairs at CMS	A measurement of the inclusive top quark-antiquark pair production cross section in proton proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used by the CMS experiment, together with the theoretical prediction at next-to-next-to-leading order, to determine the top quark mass and to extract a value\r\nof the strong coupling constant with different sets of parton distribution functions. Dilepton events are selected and the cross section is measured from a likelihood fit to the final state distributions.  The dependence of the measured cross section on the assumption on the top quark mass parameter in the POWHEG simulation is mitigated by including this parameter in the fit. The top quark mass is extracted in the pole and running mass schemes.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

The search utilizes hadronically decaying tau leptons. An interpretation of results will be shown in the context of W' boson predicted in the sequential standard model (SSM), and also nonuniversal gauge interaction model (NUGIM), in which the W' boson decays preferentially to fermions of the third generation. In addition, a model-independent limit will be shown, allowing the results to be interpreted in other models giving the same final state with similar kinematic distributions.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
528	Measurement of top-Higgs Yukawa coupling in tHq process with CMS	Probing the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling precisely is currently one of the important mandates of the LHC experiments. While the magnitude of this coupling can be determined by studying the Higgs production with top anti-top pair, the sign can be estimated using production of Higgs boson in association with a single top quark. The data collected at the LHC is not yet sensitive to the process, since, in Standard Model the rate is very low. However an anomalous coupling can enhance the production rate. Results will be presented from the analysis performed so far with LHC data by CMS collaboration along with the future prediction for constraining the coupling.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

532	Simulation studies with the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) Foils & Detectors for the CMS muon system upgrade	The Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) was first introduced by Fabio Sauli in\r\n1997, which is  a thin layer of an insulating polymer, coated on both sides with\r\ncopper and chemically perforated with a high density of microscopic holes. The GEM\r\ndetectors, which are built using GEM foils, have been utilized for various\r\napplications due to their excellent spatial resolution, high rate capabilities and\r\nflexibility in design. As this is comparatively new technology at the outset, we are\r\nperforming simulation studies for R&D of GEM foils as well as GEM detectors. Large\r\nareas of GEM are foreseen in several experiments such as the future upgrade of the\r\nCMS muon detection system, where triple GEM based detectors will be installed and\r\noperated. Since a GEM foil is stretched while building a GEM detector, we check for\r\nany deformation in the perforated holes and change in operational characteristics\r\ncaused due to stretching of the foil. Using Finite Element Analysis, stress-strain\r\ncurves are obtained to estimate possible hole and shape deformation. Further studies\r\nare being performed corresponding to different operating conditions. All these\r\nstudies are very useful for design and performance of next CMS muon endcap upgrade,\r\nnamely GE2/1 & ME0, and will prove to be beneficial for future detector development\r\nand upgrade programs at LHC, CERN.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

Among the production channels, the t-channel process is the dominant mechanism in proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC accounting for approximately 70% of the total single top quark production cross section at center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The state of the art of on single top quark t-channel measurements performed by the CMS experiment, and their impact on our knowledge of the CKM matrix elements and top quark couplings will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

535	CMS RPC system performance during RUN-2 and summary of LS2 Activities	The CMS experiment, located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN, has a redundant muon system composed by three different gaseous detector technologies: Cathode Strip Chambers (in the forward regions), Drift Tubes (in the central region), and Resistive Plate Chambers (both its central and forward regions). All three are used for muon reconstruction and triggering. The CMS RPC system confers robustness and redundancy to the muon trigger. The RPC system provides information to all muon track finders and thus contributing to both muon trigger and reconstruction. The summary of the detector performance results obtained with proton-proton collision at 13 TeV during RUN-2 data taking and the stability of the system in terms of efficiency and cluster size vs time and increasing instantaneous luminosity and data-driven predictions about the expected performance during High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) stage have been reported.

536	OT-μDTC, a test bench for testing CMS Outer Tracker Phase-2 module prototypes	The CMS Phase-2 Outer Tracker (OT) will be built by using two types of modules (strip-strip modules and pixel-strip modules) both consisting of two silicon sensors with a few millimeter separation. To read out the two types of modules four OT specific custom made chips are required: CBC (CMS Binary Chip [1]), SSA (Short Strip ASIC [2]), MPA (Macro Pixel ASIC [3]) and CIC (Concentrator Integrated Circuit [4]). The CBC and MPA (with SSA input) chips perform a spatial correlation between the hits on the top and bottom sensor to provide data ('stubs') on particles with high transverse momentum. This stub data is sent to CIC, which selects stubs with high transverse momentum. The output stub data from CIC is sent at bunch-crossing rate and the data will be used in the L1 trigger system of CMS. On a reception of a trigger the front-end chips respond by outputting the full event information. A module will thus provide two types of data: synchronous stub data and asynchronous full event data.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
537	Advanced Aging Study of Triple-GEM Detectors for CMS	A novel study is proposed and performed to better understand aging in contaminated gas mixtures in an environment of heavily ionizing particles. A 10×10 cm^2 triple-GEM prototype with 3/1/2/1 mm gap configuration is studied in the CMS - GEM QA/QC lab. The aims are to look for previously unseen aging issues related to the outgassing of some materials and to determine if particles with different specific ionization may induce aging effects which were absent in previous studies using X-rays and γ-rays. The prototype is irradiated in two different regions at the same time with two types of sources: a 5.5 MeV alpha emitter (241Am) and 5.9 keV X-ray source (55Fe) to look for different behaviors in the two areas. Hydrocarbons and silicon-based molecules are released inside the gas volume as contaminants. This simulates the pollutants released in a clean mixture during many years of normal detector operation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

542	Mapping the Redistribution of Jet Energy in PbPb Collisions with CMS	Measurements of jets produced in collisions of heavy ions, such as dijet asymmetry, boson-jet momentum imbalance, and inclusive jet spectra, have consistently indicated final states of less energy as compared to vacuum reference. This energy loss is interpreted as signature of Quark-Gluon Plasma, the hot and dense medium of deconfined partons produced in the collision of relativistic nuclei. Subsequent studies have shown that the energy lost by jets is redistributed to large angle and in multiplicities of softer particles. In this talk, a thorough accounting of jet energy redistribution through missing momentum techniques, radial scans of jet spectra, and large angle jet shapes as measured with the CMS detector. These results can distinguish between mechanisms of parton-medium interaction as encoded in various Monte Carlo and give insight into the medium response.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		871	2

The decay of the W boson pair is reconstructed in fully leptonic and semi-leptonic final states. Combined upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for heavy Higgs boson with Standard Model-like couplings and decays in the mass range are evaluated.

546	Upgrades of the CMS muon detectors: from Run-3 towards HL-LHC	The present CMS muon system consists of three different detector technologies: drift tubes (DT) and cathode strip chambers (CSC) are used in the barrel and end-cap regions of the spectrometer as offline tracking and triggering devices, whereas resistive plate chambers (RPC) are installed both in barrel and end-caps and are exploited mostly in the trigger.\r\nIn order to cope with the challenging conditions of increasing luminosity expected at HL-LHC, several upgrades of the muon detectors and trigger system are planned. In the case of DT and CSC, the electronics will be upgraded to handle higher rates, but there is no plan to replace the existing DT, CSC and RPC chambers. Therefore, accelerated ageing tests are being performed to assess the performance stability of all muon detectors under conditions which exceed, by one order of magnitude, the design specifications.\r\nNew micro-pattern gas detectors will be added to improve the performance in the forward region, more critical in terms of rates and characterized by a less uniform magnetic field. Large-area triple-foil gas electron multiplier (GEM) detectors are being already installed  during  the second LHC long shutdown covering the pseudo-rapidity (η) region 1.6 < |η|< 2.4. They will allow to control the rate of background triggers while preserving high trigger efficiency for low transverse momentum muons.\r\nFor the HL-LHC operation the muon forward region will also be enhanced with another large area GEM based station, called GE2/1, and with two new generation RPC stations, called RE3/1 and RE4/1, having low resistivity electrodes. These detectors will combine tracking and triggering capabilities and can stand particle rates up to few kHz/cm2. In addition to take advantage of the pixel tracking coverage extension a new detector, ME0 station, behind the new forward calorimeter, covering up to |η| = 2.8.\r\nWe present results about the expected performance stability of the existing muon detectors at HL-LHC. Moreover, we report on the outcome of simulation-based studies which describe the impact of the muon upgrades to the trigger and the reconstruction of muon physics objects.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
547	Search for 2HDM neutral Higgs bosons through the process H -> ZA -> llbb with the CMS detector	The standard model is one of the most successful theories at describing the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces and the interactions between the elementary particles.\r\nThe scalar boson discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) might be consistent with the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model, thus further validating this theoretical framework. However, the experimental data still leave plenty of room to determine whether or not an extension of the scalar sector is allowed.\r\nThe standard model fails to explain physical phenomena in nature, such as the presence of dark matter, the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry, the existence of massive neutrinos etc. In this respect, an extension of the scalar sector would somewhat account for phenomena not yet explained.\r\nThe Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model (2HDM) is one of the simplest extensions of the Higgs sector in the Standard model. It is theoretically built by adding a second doublet to the scalar sector, thus giving rise to three neutral and two charged Higgs bosons.\r\nWith data collected at the LHC at sqrt(s)=13TeV and L=35.9/fb, a search for a CP-even Higgs boson decaying to a lighter CP-odd Higgs boson (then decaying to bb) and a Z boson (then decaying to l+l-) is performed at CMS. The search is carried out under the assumption of classical or twisted custodial symmetry and the hypothesis of Type II Yukawa couplings.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

These are important rare decay channels to be pinned down for the standard model (SM) measurement and can be used to probe new physics.  The results are based on data collected by the CMS detector at the LHC from proton-proton collision at 13TeV with a corresponding integrated luminosity of 35.9 /fb.  When combined with earlier CMS searches at 8 TeV, 95% CL upper observed (expected) limits are set at  3.9(2.0) times the SM predicted cross-section in the Z/γ* final state, and 220 (160) and for J/ψ channel.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

A correction to the calibration constants for nonfactorization effects in the proton density is then determined. The precision of the evaluation of this correction is one of the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty for the Run 2 (2015–2018) luminosity measurement in CMS. The VdM calibration technique and the methods used to estimate the bias due to the nonfactorization assumption are discussed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
550	Sensitivity for heavy resonances at the HL-LHC with the Phase-2 CMS detector	To extend the LHC physics program, it is foreseen to operate the LHC in the future with an unprecedented high luminosity. To maintain the experiment's physics potential in the harsh environment of this so-called phase-2, the detector will be upgraded. At the same time the detector acceptance will be extended and new features such as a L1 track trigger will be implemented.\r\nSimulation studies evaluated the physics reach of benchmark searches for physics beyond the SM.  One of the open question being discussed right now, are models explaining the observed flavour anomalies. They postulate leptoquarks or Zprime-like new bosons, with enhanced couplings to third generation particles. In this context future searches in the ttbar mass spectrum are discussed, as well as searches for leptoquarks and heavy bosons with tau in the final state.  Another class of interesting models suggest compositeness, a fermion substructure, leading to a potential observation of excited leptons or composite neutrinos. All these studies show a significantly enhanced sensitivity and will shape the future research program.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

551	Precision luminosity measurement of proton-proton collisions at the CMS experiment in Run 2	Precision luminosity calibration is critical to determine fundamental parameters of the standard model and to constrain or to discover beyond-the-standard-model phenomena at LHC. The luminosity determination at the LHC interaction point 5 with the CMS detector, using proton-proton collisions at 13 and 5.02 TeV during Run 2 of the LHC (2015–2018), is reported. The absolute luminosity scale is obtained using beam-separation ("van der Meer") scans. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are related to the knowledge of the scale of the beam separation provided by LHC magnets and the non-factorizability between the spatial components of the proton bunch density distributions in the transverse direction. When applying the van der Meer calibration to the entire data-taking period, a substantial contribution to the total uncertainty in the integrated luminosity originates from the measurement of the detector linearity and stability. The reported integrated luminosity in 2015–2016 is among the most precise luminosity measurements at bunched-beam hadron colliders.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
552	 Results on the R&D campaign on the improved CMS Resistive Plate Chamber with a new Front End electronics.	The upgrade of the CMS Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) chambers consists partially of the installation of new RPC detectors in the forward region. \r\nHigh background conditions are expected in this region during the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), therefore an improved RPC detector has been proposed which sustains a higher rate capability.\r\nApart from the modified detector design, a new front-end electronics has been used which significantly reduces the threshold, being able to work with lower operational high voltage and hence reducing the effect of aging. In this work the results of the tests at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility are presented, in which the improved RPC detector with the new front-end electronics has been tested under a large gamma background using a dedicated intense muon beam. Performance results are reported as function of the background conditions, validating this detector to work under the expected background conditions at the HL-LHC.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
553	Triggering on electrons, photons, tau leptons, Jets and energy sums at HL-LHC with the upgraded CMS Level-1 Trigger	The High-Luminosity LHC will open an unprecedented window on the weak-scale nature of the universe, providing high-precision measurements of the Standard Model as well as searches for new physics beyond the standard model. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment is planning to replace entirely its trigger and data acquisition system to achieve this ambitious physics program. Efficiently collecting those datasets will be a challenging task, given the harsh environment of 200 proton-proton interactions per LHC bunch crossing. The new Level-1 trigger architecture for HL-LHC will improve performance with respect to Phase I through the addition of tracking information and subdetector upgrades leading to higher granularity and precision timing information. In this poster, we present a large panel of trigger algorithms for the upgraded Phase II trigger system, which benefit from the finer information to reconstruct optimally the physics objects. Dedicated pile-up mitigation techniques are implemented for lepton isolation, particle jets and missing transverse energy to keep the rate under control. The expected performance of the new trigger algorithms will be presented, based on simulated collision data of the HL-LHC. The selection techniques used to trigger efficiently on benchmark analyses will be presented, along with the strategies employed to guarantee efficient triggering for new resonances and other new physics signals. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
554	Emittance Scans for CMS Luminosity Calibration in run 2	The absolute luminosity calibration for LHC experiments is derived from dedicated beam separation scans, known as van der Meer (VdM) scans. However, VdM scans are performed with special beam optics, wide beams, and fewer, well-separated bunches to reduce potential systematic effects, and only once a year. In order to use the calibration obtained from a VdM scan under physics data-taking conditions with more bunches and significantly higher instantaneous luminosity, an additional measurement of the stability and linearity of the luminometers is required. Potential nonlinear effects are important especially during Run 2 (2015–2018), where pileup during physics data taking reached up to about 50.  Short VdM-type (“emittance”) scans were thus performed regularly in CMS since 2017 in the x and y planes in nine displacement steps at the beginning and end of each fill. They allowed for powerful diagnostic performance of the luminosity subdetectors in CMS throughout the year. In addition, the subdetectors that publish luminosity measurements online (BCM1F, HF, and PLT) are read out at 40 MHz, allowing the possibility of studying effects on a per bunch crossing level, correcting for beam-beam effects per bunch, and separating effects due to sequential bunches (“bunch trains”), as well as monitoring beam evolution during the fill. Linearity effects can also be measured using dedicated “mu scans” which probe a wide range of instantaneous luminosity values under physics conditions. Analyses techniques and the great potential of emittance scans in Run 3 are illustrated.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
555	Design of the CMS upgraded trigger from Phase I to Phase II of the LHC	The CMS experiment implements a sophisticated two-level triggering system composed of the Level-1, instrumented by custom-design hardware boards, and the High Level Trigger, a streamlined version of the offline reconstruction software running on a computer farm (more than 30k CPU cores). In 2017, the LHC delivered proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with a peak instantaneous luminosity larger than $2 \\cdot 10^{34} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$, more than twice the peak luminosity reached during Run1 and far larger than the design value. The CMS Level-1 trigger was upgraded during the end-of-the year technical stop between 2015 and 2016, to improve its performance at high luminosity and large number of simultaneous inelastic collisions per crossing (pile-up). All the electronic boards have been replaced and the upgraded electronics tested and commissioned with data. Smarter, more sophisticated, and innovative algorithms are now the core of the first decision layer of CMS: the upgraded trigger system implements pattern recognition and MVA (Boosted Decision Tree) regression techniques in the trigger boards for $\\text{p}_{\\text{T}}$ assignment, pile-up subtraction, and isolation requirements for electrons and tau leptons. In addition, the new global trigger is capable of evaluating complex selection algorithms such as those involving the invariant mass of trigger objects. The High Level Trigger features a trade-off between the offline complexity of the algorithms and the available computing power, and between the selection efficiency the maximum sustainable output rate. The trigger selections used in Run-2 will be presented, ranging from simpler single-object selections to more sophisticated algorithms combining different objects and applying analysis-level reconstruction and selection.  This presentation will cover the design and performance of the Phase I trigger and how it influences the path towards the Phase II upgrade necessary for the LHC run at a center-of mass energy of 14 TeV with luminosity of $5-7 \\cdot 10^{34} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$, corresponding to 140--200 pile-up events. The addition of the tracker information at Level-1 and the enhanced computing resources at HLT will maintain the trigger efficiency at a similar level as the present one.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

556	The CMS electron and photon trigger for the LHC Run 2 and plans for Run 3 	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment implements a sophisticated two-level triggering system composed of the Level-1, instrumented by custom-design hardware boards, and a software High Level Trigger. A new Level-1 trigger architecture with improved performance is now being used to maintain high physics efficiency for the more challenging conditions experienced during Run II. We present the performance of the upgraded CMS electron and photon trigger in the context of Higgs boson decays into final states with photons and electrons. The calorimeter trigger system plays a central role in achieving the ambitious physics program of Run II. The upgraded trigger benefits from an enhanced granularity of the calorimeters to optimally reconstruct the electromagnetic trigger objects. The performance of the new trigger system will be presented, based on proton-proton collision data collected in Run II. The selection techniques used to trigger efficiently on these benchmark analyses will be presented, along with the strategies employed to guarantee efficient triggering for new resonances and other new physics signals involving electron/photon final states. Plans for the LHC Run III optimizations will be described.  	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
557	Upgrade of the CSC Muon System for the CMS Detector at the HL-LHC	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be upgraded in several phases to significantly expand its physics program. After the current long shutdown from 2018-2020 (LS2) the accelerator luminosity will be increased to 2 − 3 * 10^34cm−2s−1 exceeding the design value of 1 * 10^34cm−2s−1 allowing the CMS experiment to collect approximately 100 fb−1/year. A subsequent upgrade in 2022-23 will increase the luminosity up to 5 * 10^34cm−2s−1. The CMS muon system must be able to sustain a physics program after the LS2 shutdown that  maintains sensitivity to electroweak scale physics and for TeV scale searches similar to what was achieved up to now  For the Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC) muon  detectors, the electronics will be upgraded to handle the expected higher rates.  The design of the upgraded CSC electronics will be discussed as well as the status of the first phase of the electronics installation.  In view of the operating conditions at HL-LHC, it is vital to asses the detector performance for high luminosity. Accelerated aging tests are being performed to study the behavior of the CSC detectors under conditions which are nearly an order of magnitude beyond the original design values.   The status of this irradiation campaign and results will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
558	The Particle Flow Algorithm in the Phase II Upgrade of the CMS Level-1 Trigger	The CMS experiment has greatly benefited from the utilization of the particle-flow (PF) algorithm for the offline reconstruction of the data. The Phase II upgrade of the CMS detector for the High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) includes the introduction of tracking in the Level-1 trigger, thus offering the possibility of developing a simplified PF algorithm in the Level-1 trigger. We present the logic of the algorithm, along with its inputs and possible implementation. We show that this implementation is capable of operating under the limited timing and processing resources available in the Level-1 trigger environment. The expected performance and physics implications of such an algorithm are shown using Monte Carlo samples with hιgh pile-up, simulating the harsh conditions of the HL-LHC.  New calorimeter features allow for better performance under high pileup (PU), provided that careful tuning and selection of the prompt clusters has been made. Additionally, advanced pile-up techniques are needed to preserve the physics performance in the high-intensity environment. We present a method that combines all information yielding PF candidates and performs Pile-Up Per Particle Identification (PUPPI) capable of running in the low latency level-1 trigger environment. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
559	Study of the Effects of Radiation at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility on the CMS Drift Tubes Muon Detector for the HL-LHC	The CMS drift tubes (DT) muon detector, built for standing up the LHC expected integrated and instantaneous luminosities, will be used also in the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) at a 5 times larger instantaneous luminosity and, consequently, much higher levels of radiation, reaching about 10 times the LHC integrated luminosity. Initial irradiation tests of a spare DT chamber at the CERN gamma irradiation facility (GIF++), at large (~O(100)) acceleration factor, showed aging effects resulting in a degradation of the DT cell performance [1]; however, full CMS simulations have shown almost no impact in the muon reconstruction efficiency over the full barrel acceptance and for the full integrated luminosity. A second spare DT chamber was moved inside the GIF++ bunker in October 2017. The chamber was being irradiated at lower acceleration factors, and only 2 out of the 12 layers of the chamber are switched at working voltage when the radioactive source is active, being the other layers in standby. In this way the other non-aged layers are used as reference and as a precise and unbiased telescope of muon tracks for the efficiency computation of the aged layers of the chamber, when set at working voltage for measurements. An integrated dose equivalent to two times the expected integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC run has been absorbed by this second spare DT chamber and the final impact on the muon reconstruction efficiency is under study. Direct inspection of some extracted aged anode wires presented a melted resistive deposition of materials. Investigation on the outgassing of cell materials and of the gas components used at the GIF++ are underway. Strategies to mitigate the aging effects are also being developed. From the long irradiation measurements of the second spare DT chamber, the effects of radiation in the performance of the DTs expected during the HL-LHC run will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
560	Heavy flavour jet identification with the CMS experiment in Run 2	A review of the heavy flavour identification methods and the performance results of the calibration of various taggers in Run 2 data at CMS is presented. The Machine Learning methods play an important role in the development of the identification algorithms and significantly improve the performance of heavy flavour jet tagging in the offline event reconstruction, as well as in the online event selection. An essential gain is also observed in the performance of the methods used in the identification of the decays of the lorentz-boosted objects resulting in reconstructed jets containing multiple hadrons. The outlook and projections of heavy flavour tagging performance at HL-LHC are also discussed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
561	Optimising the performance of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter to measure Higgs properties during Phase I and Phase II of the LHC	The CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL), is a high granularity lead tungstate crystal calorimeter operating at the CERN LHC.

Excellent energy resolution and efficient identification for photons are essential to reconstruct the Higgs boson in the H->gg decay channel, for measurements of the self-coupling of Higgs bosons and other related parameters.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
581	New insights into proton structure and QCD parameters using CMS measurements.

Furthermore, the constraints on the parton distribution functions of the proton can be probed by including the measurements of these processes in a QCD analysis. New insights into the proton structure and the fundamental QCD parameters will be presented, as obtained by the CMS collaboration, using the recent measurements of W+charm, top quark and jet production at 13 TeV. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
562	Performance of the BRIL Luminometers at CMS for Run 2	CMS features three luminosity subdetectors capable of providing real-time (“online”) luminosity on a bunch-by-bunch level independently of the main CMS data acquisition system: the Fast Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM1F), the hadronic forward calorimeter (HF), and the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT). These luminometers have operated since the beginning of Run 2 (2015–2018) at the LHC. In order to obtain an accurate luminosity measurement, we use van der Meer scans to provide the absolute calibration, whereas corrections for effects such as efficiency loss due to radiation damage, nonlinear effects at high instantaneous luminosity, or effects due to the bunch train structure of the beams, are measured and subsequently applied. The calibration of the online luminosity subdetectors, the applied corrections, and comparisons with offline measurements using the pixel cluster counting (PCC) method and the radiation monitoring system (RAMSES) are covered.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
563	Dark sector searches at CMS	Several theories predict dark matter to be a part of a larger dark sector of particles and forces. These dark sector particles such as dark photons, dark scalars or dark quarks may interact very weakly with standard model particles resulting in several distinct signatures in the high energy pp collision events at the LHC. This talk presents recent results from CMS on dark sector searches using data collected in LHC Run-2.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
564	New ASICs for the Very Front-End Card Upgrade of the CMS ECAL Barrel at the HL-LHC	The Compact Muon Solenoid detector (CMS) is operating at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy and with 25 ns bunch spacing. CMS was originally designed to operate for about ten years, for LHC instantaneous luminosities up to 1 x 10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a total integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{−1}$. The High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will increase the instantaneous luminosity by about a factor of 5 from current levels, resulting in a total integrated luminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$ by about 2035. The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) will face a challenging environment at the HL-LHC: higher event pileup, increasing data rates, and a harsh radiation environment. In order to maintain good detector performance in this environment, the ECAL very front-end (VFE) readout electronics have been completely redesigned, with the goals of providing precision timing, low noise, and increased sampling rate (from 40 MS/s to 160MS/s, with 12-bit resolution). To accomplish these goals, a high-speed, a Trans-Impedance Amplifier (TIA) will be used with a high resolution ADC in the upgraded VFE. Each readout channel will produce an amount of data which will require fast data transmission circuitry and fast serial links. Therefore a new digital architecture has been developed in order to achieve lossless data selection and compression. These functions has been integrated in two ASICs which will be the topic of this presentation: CATIA and LiTE-DTU, designed in commercial CMOS 110 nm and 65 nm technology, respectively.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		866	2

Displaced muons can also be used as a benchmark for new new physics searches and do require special reconstruction techinques. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
567	CMS High Level Trigger performance in Run 2	The CMS experiment selects events with a two-level trigger system, the Level-1 (L1) trigger\r\nand the High Level trigger (HLT).

The HLT has access to the full detector\r\nreadout and runs a streamlined version of the offline event reconstruction. In Run 2 the\r\npeak instantaneous luminosity reached values above 2X 10^34 cm-2 sec-1, posing a challenge\r\nto the online event selection.

570	Probing heavy quark dynamics in PbPb collisions with CMS	Measurements of heavy flavour hadrons in PbPb collisions provide information about the heavy quark dynamics inside the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks are sensitive to the transport properties of the medium and may interact with the QCD matter differently from light quarks. At low pT, heavy quarks provide a direct window on the in-medium QCD force. At high pT, the comparison of results for light and heavy particles provides insights into the expected flavor dependence of in-medium parton energy loss. Recently, the CMS collaboration established a comprehensive heavy flavor program in heavy ion collisions including the detection of charm and beauty mesons. Using the large statistics heavy ion data samples collected during LHC Run2, high precision open charm and beauty measurements are performed over a wide transverse momentum range. In this talk, the first measurement of the radial distributions of D0 mesons in jets in PbPb and pp collisions is presented, sensitive to the energy loss and diffusion of charm quarks in the QGP. Such effects for the bottom quarks are probed with the measurement of D0 mesons from b hadron decays in pp and PbPb collisions. In addition, the hadronisation of charm quarks and the importance of coalescence are constrained with the study of Lambda_c baryons in pp and PbPb collisions. Finally, results on Ds and Bs production are reported and compared to D0 and B+ production, respectively, with implications on the importance of the recombination mechanism due to strangeness enhancement.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

574	The GEM (GE1/1) Phase II Upgrade for the CMS muon system: results from in-situ demonstrator, production detector qualification, and commissioning plans.	In the next years the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be upgraded to significantly expand its physics program, increasing the luminosity up to 5 × 10^34cm^−2s^−1, well beyond the design value. An upgrade of the CMS detector is needed accordingly to cope with the expected growth in background rates, with the goal of keeping a high trigger efficiency. In this context, a first new station called GE1/1 will be installed in 2019-2020 in the CMS muon system. It will be composed by 144 Triple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors to be integrated in the CMS muon endcaps in the region closest to the beam line. A fundamental operational experience has been already achieved in 2017-2018, when a demonstrator composed of ten GE1/1 Triple-GEM detectors was installed to prove the integration of the GE1/1 system into CMS itself. In parallel, a dedicated production chain has been setup in seven production sites spread around the world, for the construction and qualification of all the detectors for the complete station. \r\nThis contribution will give a complete overview of the GE1/1 project: the detectors design and performance will be discussed, together with the lessons learned from the GE1/1 demonstrator installation, integration and operation.

587	Overview of the HL-LHC Upgrade for the CMS Level-1 Trigger	The High-Luminosity LHC will open an unprecedented window on the weak-scale nature of the universe, providing high-precision measurements of the standard model as well as searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Such precision measurements and searches require information-rich datasets with a statistical power that matches the high-luminosity provided by the Phase-2 upgrade of the LHC. Efficiently collecting those datasets will be a challenging task, given the harsh environment of 200 proton-proton interactions per LHC bunch crossing. For this purpose, CMS is designing an efficient data-processing hardware trigger (Level-1) that will include tracking information and high-granularity calorimeter information. The current conceptual system design is expected to take full advantage of advances in FPGA and link technologies over the coming years, providing a high-performance, low-latency computing platform for large throughput and sophisticated data correlation across diverse sources.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

590	Fluoride production in CMS Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) and long-term aging studies 	The Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) are gaseous detectors widely used in the muon trigger systems of LHC experiments. Gas mixtures based on HydroFluoroCarbon (HFC) components are generally used. The pollutants produced in the gas under high electrical discharge may accelerate the detectors aging, in particular the Fluorine ions (F-) produced in connection with Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) may damage the inner detector surface due to its high chemical reactivity. Dedicated measurements to estimate the HF production rate has been performed at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++) operating a spare CMS-RPC detector at different background gamma rate and with different gas volumes changes. The HF trapped inside the detector gas volume has been also estimated. The HF deposited on the inner bakelite surface has been estimated operating the detector with pure Argon. The HF study results will be presented. \r\nIn addition, in view of High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) period, a dedicated aging study is ongoing at GIF++, where few spare CMS-RPC detectors are exposed to an intense gamma radiation to estimate the impact of HL-LHC conditions, in order to confirm that the CMS-RPC system will survive to the harsher background rate expected at HL-LHC. The main detectors parameters (currents, rate, resistivity, etc.) are under monitoring as a function of the accumulated charge, and the performance studied with muon beam. After having collected a significant amount of the total irradiation preliminary results will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

The physics program of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment strongly depends on the ability to identify muons at an early trigger stage, over a momentum range spanning from few GeV to the TeV scale. Several upgrades of the muon triggers are foreseen in order to retain such capabilities in view of the the High Luminosity LHC, including the acceptance on electroweak processes and the sensitivity to physics beyon the Standard Model.\r\nWith this contribution, we review the current status of the design of highly efficient muon trigger, its architecture, based on state-of-the-art FPGAs and O(10) Gbps serial optical links, and the foreseen muon identification algorithms. We will discuss the local trigger primitives generation, depending on the new read-out of several detectors, their increased acceptance, and online muon reconstruction algorithms, both standalone and with the contribution of the silicon tracker at Level 1. The expected benefits for the HLLHC physics program are presented as well.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

605	Precision Timing with the CMS MIP Timing Detector	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is undergoing an extensive Phase II upgrade program to prepare for the challenging conditions of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In particular, a new timing layer with hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |η|=3 will measure minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with a time resolution of ~30ps. This MIP Timing Detector (MTD) will consist of a central barrel region based on LYSO:Ce crystals read out with SiPMs and two end-caps instrumented with radiation-tolerant Low Gain Avalanche Detectors. The precision time information from the MTD will reduce the effects of the high levels of pile-up expected at the HL-LHC and will bring new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. The time information assigned to each track will enable the use of 4D reconstruction algorithms and will further discriminate interaction vertices within the same bunch crossing to recover the track purity of vertices in current LHC conditions. For instance, in the analysis of di-Higgs boson production decaying to two b quarks and two photons, 30 ps timing resolution is expected to improve the effective luminosity by 22% through gains in b-tagging and photon isolation efficiency. We present motivations for precision timing at the HL-LHC and the ongoing MTD R&D targeting enhanced timing performance and radiation tolerance.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

The very high instantaneous luminosity will lead to about 200 proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing (“pileup”) superimposed to each event of interest, therefore providing extremely challenging experimental conditions.

The study of events with a vector boson accompanied by heavy-flavour jets is crucial to refine the theoretical calculations in perturbative QCD, as well as to validate associated Monte Carlo predictions. Differential cross sections in V+ c/b jets are measured as a function of several kinematic observables with the CMS detector at 8 and 13 TeV. The study of the associated production of a vector boson with jets from a c-quark is especially interesting, as it allows to extract information on the proton parton density functions.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

613	The CMS Tracker Upgrade for the High Luminosity LHC	The LHC machine is planning an upgrade program which will smoothly bring the luminosity to about $5-7.5\\times10^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ in 2028, to possibly reach an integrated luminosity of $3000-4500\\;$fb$^{-1}$ by the end of 2039. This High Luminosity LHC scenario, HL-LHC, will require an upgrade program of the LHC detectors known as Phase-2 upgrade. The current CMS Outer Tracker, already running beyond design specifications, and CMS Phase-1 Pixel Detector will not be able to survive HL-LHC radiation conditions and CMS will need completely new devices, in order to fully exploit the highly demanding conditions and the delivered luminosity. The new Outer Tracker should have also trigger capabilities. To achieve such goals, R\\&D activities have explored options for both the Outer Tracker and for the Inner Tracker. The solutions developed will allow to include tracking information in the first level trigger stage. The design choices for the Tracker upgrades are discussed along with some highlights on technological approaches and R\\&D activities.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2
614	Study of the effects of radiation on the CMS Drift Tubes Muon Detector for the HL-LHC	The CMS drift tubes (DT) muon detector, built for standing up the LHC expected integrated and instantaneous luminosities,  will be used also in the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) at a 5 times larger instantaneous luminosity and, consequently, much higher levels of radiation, reaching about 10 times the LHC integrated luminosity. Initial irradiation tests of a spare DT chamber at the CERN gamma irradiation facility (GIF++), at large (~O(100)) acceleration factor, showed aging effects resulting in a degradation of the DT cell performance [1]; however, full CMS simulations have shown almost no impact in the muon reconstruction efficiency over the full barrel acceptance and for the full integrated luminosity. A second spare DT chamber was moved inside the GIF++ bunker in October 2017. The chamber was being irradiated at lower acceleration factors, and only 2 out of the 12 layers of the chamber are switched at working voltage when the radioactive source is active, being the other layers in standby. In this way the other non-aged layers are used as reference and as a precise and unbiased telescope of muon tracks for the efficiency computation of the aged layers of the chamber, when set at working voltage for measurements. An integrated dose equivalent to two times the expected integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC run has been absorbed by this second spare DT chamber and the final impact on the muon reconstruction efficiency is under study. Direct inspection of some extracted aged anode wires presented a melted resistive deposition of materials. Investigation on the outgassing of cell materials and of the gas components used at the GIF++ are underway. Strategies to mitigate the aging effects are also being developed. From the long irradiation measurements of the second spare DT chamber, the effects of radiation in the performance of the DTs expected during the HL-LHC run will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		863	2

616	Data Scouting and Data Parking with the CMS High level Trigger	The CMS experiments has devised two new strategies at the High Level trigger, to search for\r\nnew physics in difficult corners of the phase space, or in large samples with B hadrons.\r\nThe first strategy, called Data Scouting and already introduced in Run 1, allows to take data that\r\nwould otherwise be rejected by the normal trigger filters. It is based on event-size reduction rather than event filtering and it is useful for instance to search for low mass resonances. The second strategy,  called Data Parking, aims at overcoming the main limitation in the CMS data taking, which is the computing power involved in the prompt reconstruction. In 2018, a large amount of additional data, more than 1X10^10 events containing a pair of B hadrons, was collected by CMS and parked for a delayed offline reconstruction during the Long Shutdown 2. This dataset was triggered requiring a soft displaced muon originating from the decay of a B hadron, without applying any selection on the other B hadron, allowing an unbiased sample for competitive measurements on rare B-meson decays. The challenges of both methods are reviewed in this talk.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

618	Characterisation of planar and 3D Silicon pixel sensors for the high luminosity phase of the CMS experiment at LHC  	The High Luminosity upgrade of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) calls for a new high-radiation tolerant solid-state pixel sensor, capable of surviving irradiation fluencies up to a 2.3 x 10^16 1 MeV equivalent neutrons per cm^2 at 3 cm from the interaction point. To this extent, the INFN ATLAS-CMS joint research activity, in collaboration with Fondazione Bruno Kessler, is aiming at the development of thin n-in-p type pixel sensors to be operated at the HL-LHC. The R&D covers both planar and single-sided 3D columnar pixel devices made with the Si-Si Direct Wafer Bonding technique, which allows for the production of sensors with 100 μm and 130 μm active thickness, for planar sensors, and 130 μm for 3D sensors, the thinnest ones ever produced so far. Prototypes of hybrid modules have been bump-bonded to the RD53A readout chip. The RD53A readout chip have been developed by the RD53 collaboration as a first step to the design of a readout chip for the pixel detectors of the ATLAS and CMS experiments during the high luminosity phase of the LHC. Test beam studies, both of thin planar and 3D devices, have been performed by the CMS collaboration at the Fermilab and CERN test beam facilities. First results of the modules performance before and after irradiation are reported in this presentation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

620	Background in the CMS muon detectors: simulation and measure with pp collision data	The CMS muon system is built of different detector technologies: Drift Tube chambers (DT) and Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) serve as tracking and triggering detectors respectively in the barrel and the end-caps of the spectrometer, whereas Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) complement DT and CSC and are mostly used in the trigger. In addition, multiple layers of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) chambers are being installed in the muon system end-caps at different stages of the CMS upgrade programme. \r\nA measure of the background hit rates and currents drained by the different muon detectors during the LHC Run-2 is of prime importance for an assessment of the longevity of the chambers and their on-board electronics, which are critical for the projection of the expected performance of the system at HL-LHC. Moreover, an accurate modelling of the backgrounds using simulations is also critical. In fact, an estimation of the change in backgrounds as a consequence of the evolution of the CMS detector geometry expected for the Phase-2 upgrade, can only be performed rely on Montecarlo-based predictions.\r\nThe state of the art of the understanding of the backgrounds measured with data collected during the LHC Run-2, as well as at CERN high-intensity gamma irradiation facility, (GIF++), will be discussed. Additionally, the work made to improve the accuracy of  the background modelling in Fluka and GEANT4 simulations will be also presented.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		863	2

Total and differential cross sections of vector bosons produced in association with jets have been studied in pp collisions at 7, 8 and 13 TeV center-of-mass energies. Differential distributions as function of a broad range of kinematical observables are measured and compared with theoretical predictions. Final states with a vector boson and jets can be also used to study electroweak initiated processes, such as the vector boson fusion production of a Z or W boson that are accompanied by a pair of energetic jets with large invariant mass.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		864	2

623	Test Beam Measurements of the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter for HL-LHC	As part of the HL-LHC detector upgrade programme, the CMS experiment is developing a High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) to replace the existing endcap calorimeters. The HGCAL will be realised as a sampling calorimeter, including 36 layers of silicon pads and 14 layers combining both silicon and scintillator detectors interspersed with metal absorber plates. Prototype modules based on 6-inch hexagonal silicon pad sensors with pad areas of 1.0 cm2 have been constructed. Beam tests of different sampling configurations made from these modules have been conducted at the CERN SPS using beams of charged hadrons and electrons with momenta ranging from 20 to 350 GeV/c. The setup was complemented with a CALICE AHCAL prototype, a scintillator-based sampling calorimeter, mimicking the proposed design of the HGCAL scintillator part. This talk summarises the test beam measurements at CERN in 2018, including measurements of pedestal and noise, gain characterisation, calibration with single charged particles and energy reconstruction performance of electron and hadron induced showers. We also show measurements of the timing capabilities of this prototype system and the steps being taken towards electron and hadron identification.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		863	2
624	Upgrade of the CMS Muon Spectrometer in the forward region with the GEM technology	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be upgraded in several phases that will allow significant expansion of its physics program. The final luminosity of the accelerator is expected to exceed 5 × 1034cm−2s−1, five times more the original design value. The CMS muon system must be able to sustain a physics program after the increase of luminosity and maintain sensitivity for electroweak physics for TeV scale searches similar to what was achieved up to now. To cope with the corresponding increase in background rates and trigger requirements, the installation of additional sets of muon detectors based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) technology, referred to as GE1/1, GE2/1 and ME0, has been planned. \r\nThe installation and commissioning of the GE1/1 chambers is scheduled by 2019/20, while the GE2/1 and ME0 detectors are expected to be installed between 2022 and 2024.\r\nWe present an overview of the Muon Spectrometer upgrade using GEM technology, a description of the ongoing GE1/1 project: production, qualification, installation and details of the GE2/1 and ME0 upgrade.

This will allow the ATLAS and CMS experiments to collect integrated luminosities up to 3000-4500 fb^−1 during the project lifetime. To cope with this extreme scenario the CMS detector will be substantially upgraded before starting the HL-LHC, a plan known as CMS Phase-2 upgrade. CMS Tracker detector will have to be replaced in order to fully exploit the delivered luminosity and cope with the demanding operating conditions. The new detector will provide robust tracking as well as input for the first level trigger.

636	YSF: Searches for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of pseudoscalars in CMS	Several theories extending the Standard Model (SM) have predicted the existence of addi-\r\ntional Higgs bosons. Searches for these extra Higgs bosons have focused primarily on general\r\ntwo Higgs doublet models (2HDM), however models where the two Higgs doublets are extended\r\nby one additional Higgs singlet complex field (2HD+1S) are consistent with SM measurements\r\nand constraints from searches for additional Higgs bosons. Moreover, 2HD+1S models such\r\nas the next-to-minimal supersymmetric (NMSSM) models can solve the so-called μ-problem\r\nof the MSSM and comfortably accommodate the 125 GeV Higgs boson in the mass spectrum.\r\nHere a series of searches performed in CMS on possible exotic decays of the Higgs boson to a\r\npair of pseudoscalars considering different decay channels are presented. The searches cover a\r\nwide range of masses for the pseudoscalar boson, which span from very boosted to non-boosted\r\ntopologies.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		875	2
637	YSF: Search for a heavy scalar decaying to W boson pair	A search for a heavy scalar decaying to a pair of W bosons in the mass range from 200 GeV to 5 TeV is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. The decay of the W boson pair is reconstructed in fully leptonic and semi-leptonic final states. Combined upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for heavy particle with Standard Model-like couplings and decays in the mass range are evaluated. Exclusion limits are also set in the context of two Higgs doublet models.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		875	2
638	YSF:Search for a standard model-like Higgs boson in the mass range between 70 and 110 GeV in the diphoton final state in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 and 13 TeV	The results of a search for a new resonance decaying into two photons using proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV and  $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV  are presented for a diphoton invariant mass in the range between 70 and 110 GeV.

653	Search for associated production of a Higgs boson and a single top quark in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV	A search is presented for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The production cross section for this process is highly sensitive to the absolute values of the top quark Yukawa coupling, the Higgs boson coupling to vector bosons, and, uniquely, to their relative sign. Analyses using multilepton signatures, targeting H → WW, H → ττ, and H → ZZ decay modes, and signatures with a single lepton and a bb pair, targeting the H → bb decay, are combined with a reinterpretation of a measurement in the H → γγ channel to constrain the Yukawa coupling.  Results from the 2016 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1, will be presented, along with prospects for future measurements.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

681	Rare Higgs Decays into Quarkonia Pairs	Rare decays of the Higgs boson to mesons are a promising laboratory to study couplings to lighter quarks and physics beyond the standard model. A search for decays of the Higgs and the Z boson to pairs of J/ψ and Y resonances with subsequent decays of the mesons into muon pairs is performed with the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A data sample of proton-proton collisions collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used.

657	Measurement of  the top quark Yukawa coupling from tt¯ differential cross sections in the lepton+jets final state in proton-proton collisions at sqrt()=13 TeV	We present a measurement of the top quark Yukawa coupling derived from the top quark-antiquark (tt¯) differential production cross sections.  tt¯ is reconstructed in the lepton+jets channel. Corrections to tt¯ production due to virtual exchange of electroweak bosons, including the Higgs boson, can produce large distortions of differential distributions near the production. Therefore precise measurements of these distributions are sensitive to the value of Yukawa coupling. This analysis is based on data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at √=13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb−1. Top quark events are reconstructed with at least three jets in the final state. A novel technique is introduced to reconstruct the tt¯ system for events with one missing jet. This technique enhances the experimental sensitivity in the low invariant mass region, tt¯. The data yields in tt¯, the rapidity difference |t−t¯|, and the number of reconstructed jets are compared with distributions representing different Yukawa couplings. These comparisons are used to extract an upper limit on the top quark Yukawa coupling of 1.67 (1.62 expected) at 95% confidence level.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
658	Searching for resonant HH production in the bbqqlnu final state at CMS	New, massive bosons could be found with the LHC. Theories with warped extra dimensions and supersymmetry predict the existence of such resonances, which for some model parameters, have a significant branching fraction to two Higgs bosons. A search for such particles in the HH->bbWW->bbqqlnu channel with the CMS detector is presented. The analysis uses data collected during Run 2 of the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Background is suppressed by reconstructing the full HH decay chain using jet substructure techniques and the identification of leptons with nearby, boosted jets. A two-dimensional template fit in the plane of resonance the mass and the H->bb mass is used to characterize potential signal with this final state. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

661	Tools for Trigger Rate Monitoring at CMS	Designed to push forward our understanding of fundamental physics at the energy frontier, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is one of the two general-purpose particle detectors at the LHC. Collisions take place within CMS at approximately 40 MHz, producing much more data than can be recorded or stored for future analysis. However, only a small fraction of the collisions contain events likely to be associated with new or interesting phenomena. In order to select as many of these potentially interesting events as possible while reducing the rate to a more manageable 1 kHz, CMS employs a two-tiered trigger system consisting of a hardware based Level-1 (L1) Trigger and a software based High Level Trigger (HLT). Monitoring the output rates of the trigger paths is of key importance to determining the overall performance of the trigger system; these rates are also very sensitive to the performance of all aspects of the detector, so rate monitoring can often provide the first indication of issues that arise within the various sub-detectors of CMS as well. This presentation will discuss the CMS trigger system and describe the software tools developed and used by CMS to characterize, monitor, and visualize the L1 and HLT trigger rates.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
662	Search for supersymmetry in events with tau leptons with the CMS experiment	We present the results of searches for supersymmetry in final states with tau leptons using data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 137 /fb. A variety of supersymmetric scenarios in which tau sleptons may be produced are considered, targeting scenarios in which tau sleptons could be amongst the lightest supersymmetric particles. These searches are particularly intriguing in the light of tau slepton-neutralino coannihilation models that could explain the observed dark matter relic density. Deep learning is used in some cases to enhance the performance of algorithms used to identify hadronic tau decays.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
663	The Physics and Instrumentation of Precision Timing in CMS	As part of the Phase II upgrade program for HL-LHC, the CMS Detector will be instrumented with a new precision timing layer (the MIP Timing Detector), dedicated to providing timing information (with resolution of ~30-40 ps) for charged particles. This upgrade will reduce the effects of pile-up expected at the HL-LHC and will bring new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. We will discuss precision timing as a pathfinder for new physics in both the multi-TeV and low energy ranges. In this context, we will present prospects for long-lived particles in various BSM theoretical models and low energy precision particle identification, for example in the Higgs and heavy flavor sectors. An overview of the instrumentation challenges for precision timing systems at the HL-LHC will be discussed. The talk also will discuss performance as a function of precision and applications of precision timing beyond collider physics.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

Looking to Run 3 and high-luminosity LHC, the data rates required by the HL-LHC physics program will far outstrip what can be provided by the current analysis and production computing approaches. In this presentation, we will discuss how the entire offline system of the CMS experiment is evolving in anticipation of increased data volumes, increased rate of pileup interactions and the evolution of computing technology. We will discuss short-term developments and longer-term ideas including changes to distributed analysis-data structures and data reduction approaches; adoption of modern software development practices; the use of hardware accelerators; and novel approaches to simulation, reconstruction and analysis algorithms.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
665	Results and prospects with the CMS-TOTEM Precision Proton Spectrometer	The PPS (Precision Proton Spectrometer) detector system consists of silicon tracking stations as well as timing detectors to measure both the position and direction of protons and their time-of-flight with high precision. They are located at around 200 m from the interaction point in the very forward region on both sides of the CMS experiment. PPS is built to study Central Exclusive Production (CEP) in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, including the photon-photon production of W and Z boson pairs, high-mass diphoton and dilepton production, high-$p_T$ jet production, as well as searches for anomalous couplings and new resonances. The PPS detector has taken data at high luminosity while fully integrated to the CMS experiment. The total data collected correspond to around 100 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$ during the LHC Run 2. In this presentation the PPS operation, commissioning and performance are discussed. We will also present the first results and the physics prospects from the CMS Precision Proton Spectrometers, in particular the observation of exclusive dileptons at high mass with 10 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of data accumulated in 2016. This result shows a good understanding, calibration and alignment of the new PPS detectors.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
666	Future prospects for Higgs physics at the LHC and beyond	The analysis of data collected by the CMS experiment at a collision energy of\r\n13 TeV for the Run 2 provided confirmation of the existence of a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV and all the measurements about\r\nits properties were found consistent with the Standard Model predictions.  Nevertheless a full reality of the Higgs mechanism to give mass\r\n to the particles cold not be established wit the statistics of Run 2 data and at the same time the Run 2 data analysis opened a wide scenario\r\n for searches for physics beyond Standard Model, even in the Higgs sector.  An upgrade program is planned for the\r\nLHC which will smoothly bring the luminosity up to or above 5x10^34cm^-2s^-1\r\nsometimes after 2020, to possibly reach an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb-1\r\nat the end of that decade. For this ultimate scenario, called Phase-2, when\r\nLHC will reach the High Luminosity phase (HL-LHC), the CMS detector will\r\nbe upgraded to fully exploit the highly-demanding operating conditions and the\r\ndelivered luminosity (giving up to 200 pileup events).  Precision measurements in the Higgs sector are planned and \r\nprospective studies have been done in the last year to explore the CMS potential in the Higgs sector in the high luminosity scenario of the LHC. \r\nThe latest results will be summarized in this seminar. \r\nIn addition  new future projects involving larger and more powerful accelerators would provide more precise measurements in the Higgs sector and shed light on the \r\nself-couplings of the Higgs boson and more, etc.; current studies will be briefly described	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
667	Heavy Ion quarkonia and heavy flavor CMS + ATLAS results	Measurements of heavy flavor hadrons and quarkonia in heavy ion collisions provide information about the in-medium color interaction inside the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the high-density QCD medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Quarkonia, which are pairs of a heavy quark and an anti-quark, could be used to study the modification of color potential between the pairs. Heavy quarks are sensitive to the transport properties of the medium and may interact with the QCD matter differently from light quarks. As the main observables to study the medium effect, nuclear modification factors (RAA) of heavy-flavor particles provide insights into the flavor dependence of in-medium parton energy loss. In addition, azimuthal anisotropy coefficients (vn) of heavy-flavor particles provide information about the degree of the thermalization of the bulk medium. Over the past few years, using the large statistics proton-proton and Pb-Pb samples collected at 5.02TeV during the 2015 LHC run, high precision measurements of charm and beauty mesons have been performed with the CMS and the ATLAS detector over a wide transverse momentum range. In this talk, recent results from the CMS and ATLAS experiments on quarkonia and heavy flavor studies in heavy ion collisions are summarized and the implications on future measurements are discussed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

671	Measurement of top quark decay width in the dilepton channel from pp collisions at 13 TeV with CMS data	We present a direct measurement of the top quark decay width with events from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data were taken by the CMS detector in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The measurement is performed using the dilepton final state of the ttbar system which are selected containing two charged leptons and at least two jets, with at least one jet being identified as coming from a b quark. The distribution of the invariant mass of the lepton-b jet pairs is reconstructed in different categories depending on the multiplicity of b-jets and on the transverse momentum of the pairs. The distributions are compared to different hypothesis of the width and mass of the top quark which have been simulated at next-to-leading order QCD. A combined profile likelihood fit is used to extract both parameters simultaneously. After profiling the top quark mass we expect to measure the width with a 30% relative uncertainty.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
672	CMS High Granularity Calorimeter for High Luminosity LHC	The High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will integrate about 10 times more luminosity than the LHC, posing significant challenges for radiation tolerance and event pileup on detectors, especially for forward calorimetry. As part of its HL-LHC upgrade program, the CMS collaboration is designing a High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) to replace the existing endcap calorimeters. It features unprecedented transverse and longitudinal segmentation for both electromagnetic (CE-E) and hadronic (CE-H) compartments to facilitate particle-flow calorimetry. The fine structure of showers can be measured and used to enhance pileup rejection and particle identification, whilst achieving good energy resolution. The CE-E and a large fraction of CE-H will use Silicon sensors as active detector material. The lower-radiation environment will be instrumented with scintillator tiles with on-tile SiPM readout. The Silicon sensors will be of hexagonal shape, maximizing the available 8-inch circular wafer area. An overview of the HGCAL project is presented, summarizing motivation, the main engineering design choices and the R&D program.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
673	Calibration and Performance of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter in LHC Run 2	Many physics analyses using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC require accurate, high-resolution electron and photon energy measurements. Excellent energy resolution is crucial for studies of Higgs boson decays with electromagnetic particles in the final state, as well as searches for additional intermediate or high-mass resonances decaying to energetic photons or electrons. The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a fundamental instrument for these analyses and its energy resolution is crucial for the Higgs boson mass measurement. Recently the energy response of the calorimeter has been precisely calibrated exploiting the full Run 2 data, aiming at a legacy reprocessing of the data. A dedicated calibration of each detector channel has been performed with physics events exploiting electrons from W and Z boson decays, photons from pi0/eta decays, and from the azimuthally symmetric energy distribution of minimum bias events. This talk presents the calibration strategies that have been implemented and the excellent performance achieved by the CMS ECAL with the ultimate calibration of Run 2 data, in terms of energy scale stability and energy resolution.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

Low-mass, high bandwidth electrical links transfer the data at a speed of 1.28 Gbps from the readout chip to a low power gigabit transceiver. This transceiver will further send the serialized data at the rate of 10 Gbps through optical links to the Tracker backend electronics.    The design, development, and plans for this readout chain will be discussed.  	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
675	The CMS GEM upgrade and performance of prototype detectors	The High Luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) will result in increase of beam energy and the collision rate compared to the current situation, and will highly affect the radiation environment of the CMS detector especially in the reconstruction of low pT processes. The challenge for the CMS is to maintain an efficient and reliable trigger in the |eta| > 1.6 region. This is particularly important to study many Beyond Standard Model (BSM)  physics process with muons in the final state. Therefore, CMS Muon group has proposed the use of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) technology to curb high particle backgrounds. The detector technology will be integrated with the CMS over the next several upgrades in the form of many stations. One such station known as GE1/1 will be installed during 2019-2020. These GE1/1 chambers are trapezoidal in shape and will cover 1.6 < |eta| < 2.2 region of the endcap. Several such chambers have been assembled and tested. We provide the current status of GE1/1 project, future GEM upgrade plans and its impact on CMS to explore new physics. We also report on GE1/1 layout, their assembly and performance studies such as gain, efficiency, timing, etc. estimated during the years of R&D and several beam tests at CERN. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
676	Upgrade of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter barrel readout electronics for the High-Luminosity LHC	The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a homogeneous calorimeter made of about 75000 lead tungstate scintillating crystals. In view of the high-luminosity phase of the LHC, the ECAL readout electronics must be upgraded to cope with the more stringent requirements in terms of trigger latency and rate, as well as the harsh radiation environment and the extreme level of pile-up events, with up to 200 simultaneous proton-proton collisions. The new electronics will transmit the data in streaming mode from the front-end electronics to the off-detector electronics, where the trigger primitives will be formed in powerful FPGAs. The front-end electronics will feature two new radiation-hard chips: a dual gain trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) and a sampling ADC with lossless data compression. The TIA choice allows the preservation of the fast pulse shape of the lead tungstate coupled to avalanche photodiodes (APD), and it is more resistant to the noise increase due to the radiation-induced APD leakage current. An important characteristic of the new design will be the capability to provide precision timing measurements, of the order of 30 ps, for photons and electrons above 50 GeV. The excellent time resolution will improve the overall CMS physics performance by mitigating the high pile-up effects. First characterization results of the TIA chip will be shown, and studies of energy and timing resolution performed in beam tests with the electronic prototypes will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

678	CMS trigger in Phase-2	The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will open an unprecedented window on the weak-scale\r\nnature of the universe, providing high-precision measurements of the standard model as well as searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Such precision measurements and searches require information-rich datasets with a statistical power that matches the high luminosity provided by the Phase-2 upgrade of the LHC. Efficiently collecting those datasets will be a challenging task, given the harsh pileup environment of 200 proton-proton interactions per LHC bunch crossing. CMS uses a two level trigger system to select potentially interesting events. The detector readout electronics and DAQ will be upgraded to allow a maximum L1A rate of 750 kHz, and a latency of 12.5 µs (or 500 LHC bunch crossings). In addition, the L1 trigger will, for the first time, include tracking information and high-granularity calorimeter information.

The MTD will provide hermetic timing coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |η| = 3, with time resolution better than 40 ps. In the high-radiation forward region from |η|=1.6 and 3.0, this is achieved with the Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) that is based on silicon low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs). An extensive LGAD R&D program is ongoing to characterize sensor performance to develop LGADs suitable for ETL. We discuss the details of the automated test beam DAQ environment developed for efficient characterization of prototype LGAD sensors at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF), and the latest results for sensors produced by Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) with a focus on characterization of radiation hardness and uniformity.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

695	Search for Supersymmetry at CMS in Events with Large Jet Multiplicity and Low Missing Transverse Momentum at sqrt(s)=13 TeV	In traditional searches for physics beyond the standard model, a requirement of high missing transverse momentum (MET) is often used. However, without any signs of significant deviations from the standard model expectations, we decided to relax this requirement for the search reported in this talk. Many new physics models, including versions of supersymmetry (SUSY) characterized by R-parity violation, compressed mass spectra, long decay chains, or with additional hidden sectors predict the production of events with low MET, many jets, and top quarks. The results of a general search for new physics featuring two top quarks and six additional light flavor jets are reported. The search is performed using events with at least seven jets and exactly one electron or muon. No requirement on MET is imposed. With the use of a neural-network-based signal-to-background discriminator, a background estimation was achieved were more traditional techniques was not an option. The study is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV corresponding to 77.4 fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and 2017. Results of the search are interpreted for pair production of scalar top quarks in the frameworks of stealth SUSY and SUSY with R-parity violation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
696	A Search for Di-Leptonic Final State  Vector-Like Quark Pair Production in 13 TeV $pp$ Collisions using CMS Data	We describe a search for the production of a pair of vector-like quarks (VLQ's) with masses greater than 1000 GeV/c$^2$in a di-lepton final state using data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS Experiment. The analysis is based on detection of a di-lepton pair from the decay of a $Z$ boson and is sensitive to events in which one VLQ decays to a $b$ quark and a $Z$ boson and the other to a $b$ quark and either a $Z$ or a Higgs boson. Requiring that the event kinematics are consistent with a di-leptonic $Z$ decay, with either a $Z$ or Higgs decaying to jets and that the reconstructed VLQ's have equal masses greatly reduces the background from Standard Model processes.   We use a $\\chi^2$ procedure based on the Higgs or $Z$ mass and the equality of the two VLQ masses to select the correct combinations of jets. Since for a highly boosted Higgs or $Z$, the two jets resulting from the daughter quarks might be merged to a single jet, we carry out two independent analyses depending on the number of observed jets. We present the expected exclusion limits from the  combined analyses corresponding to 138 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected by CMS during the  2016, 2017 and 2018 run period.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
697	A Search for Fully Hadronic Final State Vector-Like Quark Pair Production in 13 TeV pp Collisions using CMS Data	We describe a search for the production of a pair of vector-like quarks (VLQ's) with masses greater than 1000 GeV/c$^2$ each decaying into a $b$ quark and a Higgs Boson using data from proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS Experiment. Since the predominant decay mode of the Higgs boson is to a $b \\bar{b}$ pair, the analysis focuses on a final state consisting of jets resulting from the $b(\\bar{b})$ quarks produced in the VLQ decays.  Requiring that the jets are consistent with production of a pair of Higgs, that the reconstructed VLQ's have equal masses  and that several of the jets are tagged as originating from $b(\\bar{b})$ quarks, greatly reduces the background from Standard Model processes. We use a $\\chi^2$ procedure based on the Higgs masses and the equality of the two VLQ masses to select the correct combinations of jets. Since for highly boosted Higgs, the two jets resulting from the daughter $b(\\bar{b})$ quarks might be merged to a single jet, we carry out three independent analyses depending on the number of observed jets. We present the expected exclusion limits from the three combined analyses corresponding to 138 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected by CMS during the 2016, 2017 and 2018 run period.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

706	Precision Timing in the CMS Endcap with Low Gain Avalanche Detectors	The MIP Timing Detector (MTD) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is designed to provide precision timing information (with resolution of ~40 ps) for charged particles (MIPs), with hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |η|=3. The endcap region of MTD, called the Endcap Timing Layer (ETL), covers the high radiation pseudo-rapidity region between |η|=1.6 and 3.0. The ETL will be instrumented with silicon-based low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs). Each endcap will be instrumented with a two-disk system of LGADs, read out by Endcap Timing Readout Chips (ETROCs) designed for precision timing measurements.

707	Use of Boosted Decision Tree based Auto Categorizer for VLQ Searches.	Discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012 at the LHC is a crowning achievement and has altered our perception of how nature operates.  The low mass of the Higgs has focused our efforts on searching for evidence of physics beyond the standard model. CMS has been searching for hypothetical heavy quark partners called Vector-Like-Quarks, T/B, which appear in SUSY, 2HDM and other composite Higgs models [1]. The VLQs are color charged fermions whose left- and right-hand field components transform in the same manner under the SU(2)×U(1) electroweak gauge symmetry. Specifically, T, with charge 2e/3, are predicted to decay to bW, tZ, and tH while B, with charge -e/3, are predicted to decay to tW, bZ, and bH. A search for T/B pair production with leptonic final state signatures (single lepton / same-sign dilepton /trilepton channel) was performed on data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 with integrated luminosity of 36.9fb^{-1} at \\sqrt{s}= 13 TeV.  We are investigating ways to improve the expected sensitivity of the search. A potential technique is to optimize the final event categorization based on number of jets, b-jets, W Boson and Higgs Boson tagging using a decision tree with the AutoCategorizer algorithm [2]. We apply this technique to the analysis published using the 2016 dataset and explore the capability of the AutoCategorizer to enhance the expected significance of T/B search with a luminosity corresponding to the full Run 2 dataset.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

711	Test beam characterization of Hamamatsu LGADs for the CMS endcap timing layer	The high luminosity (HL) upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will help to achieve instantaneous luminosity a factor of five larger than the current value and will enable the experiments to increase their data sets significantly. However, the number of simultaneous proton-proton interactions in the time span of 25 ns will be as high as 200 at the HL-LHC. To mitigate these effects, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector will be upgraded with a timing layer capable of detecting minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with a timing resolution of 40 ps or less. The endcap region of the timing layer (ETL), covering pseudorapidity range from 1.6 to 3.0, will be constructed out of low gain avalanche detectors (LGAD). This poster will describe R&D with Hamamatsu (HPK) LGADs and their characterization at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. Specifically, the poster will present the latest test beam results such as the timing performance after irradiation, the sensor uniformity, and the size of the inactive region between adjacent pads. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
712	YSF: Search for supersymmetry with a compressed mass spectrum in the vector boson fusion topology with 1-lepton and 0-lepton final states	In R-parity conserving supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, the lightest neutralino $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$, which is also the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), plays the role of the canonical dark matter particle candidate. The traditional $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$ searches using Drell-Yan processes suffer in the compressed spectrum scenarios, where the LSP mass is only slightly less than the masses of other charginos and neutralinos. Therefore, new experimental techniques are needed in order to facilitate the detection of missing $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$ momentum in the event and the identification of the soft decay products characterizing these scenarios. In this talk, we present a summary of the search for chargino ($\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{\\pm}$) - neutralino ($\\tilde{\\chi}_{2}^{0}$) production via pure electroweak vector boson fusion processes using data from $pp$ collisions at  = 13 TeV collected in 2016 with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The final states considered consist of one or zero leptons, large missing transverse momentum, and two jets with a large separation in rapidity. The observed dijet invariant mass and lepton-neutrino transverse mass distributions are consistent with the standard model predictions. Upper limits on the cross section for chargino $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{\\pm}$ and neutralino $\\tilde{\\chi}_{2}^{0}$ production associated with two jets are set. In the compressed mass spectra scenario, where 1 (30) GeV, gaugino masses up to 112 (215) GeV for the mass-degenerate particles $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{\\pm}$ and $\\tilde{\\chi}_{2}^{0}$ are excluded at 95\\% CL. This analysis obtains the most stringent limits to date on the production of chargino and neutralinos in the compressed mass spectrum scenarios with 1 $\\leq \\Delta m \r\n\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		882	2
713	[YSF] Search for the compressed SUSY in stau-neutralino coannihilation region with a soft tau lepton and ISR jets	A search for compressed supersymmetry in the stau-neutralino ($\\tilde{\\tau}\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{1}$) coannihilation region is presented.  The search targets final states with exactly one low-energy (``soft'') hadronically-decaying $\\tau$ lepton and large missing transverse momentum ($\\vec{E}^{miss}_{T}$) due to the natural kinematic boost from a high transverse momentum jet from initial state radiation (ISR).  The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 77.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected with CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 and 2017.  The distribution of the transverse mass between the $\\tau_{h}$ and the $\\vec{E}^{miss}_{T}$ is found to be consistent with the standard model predictions.  Upper limits are set on the cross section for chargino ($\\tilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_{1}$) and neutralino ($\\tilde\\chi^{0}_{2}$) production with an associated ISR jet.  For a compressed mass spectrum scenario in which the mass difference between the $\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{1}$ and the $\\tilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_{1}$ is 50 GeV, an upper limit of 290 GeV is set on the mass of the $\\tilde\\chi^{\\pm}_{1}$, which exceeds the sensitivity obtained by other $\\tilde{\\tau}$ searches to date. Finally, the results are also interpreted considering direct production of $\\tilde{\\tau}$ pairs with associated ISR jets.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		882	2
714	Optimizing the performance of the CMS ECAL trigger for Runs 2 and 3 of the CERN LHC	The CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is a high resolution crystal calorimeter operating at the CERN LHC.

716	Role of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter in the measurement of Higgs boson properties at LHC Run 2 and projections for the HL-LHC with the CMS Phase-2 detector	The characterization of the properties of the Higgs boson relies on the precise determination of its mass, width, and couplings. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment (CMS) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) plays a crucial role in such a task: maintaining and improving the excellent performance achieved in Run 1 is fundamental for measurements in the highest-resolution channels H->gamma gamma and H->ZZ->4 leptons. The energy reconstruction algorithms and clustering techniques, developed to maintain the excellent performance of the CMS ECAL throughout Run 2, are presented.  The high-luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) is expected to deliver an integrated luminosity of up to 3000 fb^{-1}. The large number of events expected will allow even more precise measurements of the Higgs boson properties, given that the expected overall statistical, experimental, and theoretical uncertainties are comparable in size. However, the very high instantaneous luminosity will lead to about 200 overlapping proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing ("pileup"). To cope with this extremely challenging experimental environment, an upgrade of the ECAL is foreseen. With the upgrade, ECAL will provide a timing precision of about 30 ps that will guarantee substantially improved pileup mitigation and event reconstruction. The improvements to CMS physics analyses provided by this upgrade, as well as prospects for Higgs self-coupling measurements and HH production at the HL-LHC, are presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
717	YSF: Searching for Dark Matter with Semi-Visible Jets at CMS	Most theories that predict dark matter production at colliders rely on weakly coupled dark matter and the existence of WIMPs, or weakly interacting massive particles; however, there can be dark matter signatures in colliders that emerge from strongly coupled dark matter. These signatures are varied, ranging from emerging jets to Stealth Dark Matter. Another possible signature is semi-visible jets. These occur if the dark sector is comprised of a strong-like structure with dark hadrons made up of dark quarks. Once produced, a heavy dark quark would then hadronize into stable dark "pions", which leave the detector as dark matter, and unstable dark hadrons that shower and appear as SM hadronic showers. Since the true jet is made up of visible SM quarks and missing transverse energy closely aligned with the shower, the jet is called semi-visible. This presentation will discuss a Hidden Valley theory that results in such a signature, as well as a work-in-progress analysis by members of the CMS Collaboration trying to find this signature.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		882	2
718	Gas Mixture Longevity Studies for the CMS Cathode Strip Chambers in Preparation of HL-LHC	The muon system of the CMS experiment includes 540 Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) that serve as the primary source for muon detection and triggering in the endcap region. The CSCs are intended to operate throughout the lifetime of the CMS experiment, including the challenging environment of the HL-LHC era. To access the longevity of the CSCs over the HL-LHC lifespan, a recent campaign of accelerated irradiation studies has been performed at the CERN GIF++ facility. Following, additional irradiation tests of both standard and prototype CSCs with a reduced concentration of CF4 in the gas mixture were also conducted, as part of CERN’s intention to minimize greenhouse gas consumption. Introductory studies with a CF4 substitute of lower global warming potential, the hydrofluoroolefine HFO-1234ze, are also being conducted, in the interest of assessing its impact on chamber performance and longevity.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
719	YSF: Search for inelastic dark matter with the CMS detector	Searches for dark matter at the LHC have largely focused on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). But what if instead of just one type of dark matter particle, there exists a richer dark sector hidden from ordinary view? This opens up a whole new paradigm for dark matter searches, allowing us to focus not only on the coupling between dark matter and the Standard Model, but also on the interactions between dark matter constituents themselves. The LHC is in a unique position to investigate such a rich dark sector which is otherwise difficult to probe with direct and indirect detection techniques. In this talk, I will describe a new, ongoing search for dark matter with the CMS detector, using inelastic dark matter (iDM) predictions as a guide. The iDM model offers a unique and striking long-lived final-state signature at the LHC, which can be exploited to access a significant fraction of unexplored dark matter parameter space. I will review the iDM model, describe the main features of the expected signature, and discuss the ongoing efforts at CMS to look for this signal.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		882	2
720	The CMS ECAL Laser Monitoring system: study of crystal transparency loss and proposed upgrade for the High-Luminosity LHC	The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL), one of the main subsystems of the CMS detector, measures the energies of electrons and photons. The ECAL is made of 75848 lead tungstate (PbWO_4) crystals. The transparency of crystals is affected by irradiation and the laser monitoring system is designed to measure the transparency changes for each ECAL crystal over time. The aging of the light distribution system under irradiation is also taken into account. In the future, the High-Luminosity LHC upgrade will increase the integrated luminosity of the LHC, providing a much larger dataset for physics to the LHC experiments. This upgrade will lead to higher radiation damage in all the components of the CMS detector. The mitigation of aging is an important goal for the upgrade of the laser light monitoring system. In this talk we report crystal transparency results based on Run 2 data, and we describe the proposed upgrade for the light distribution system.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2
721	Search for ttH production in the H → bb decay channel at CMS	A search for associated production of a standard model Higgs boson with a top quark-antiquark pair (ttH), in which the Higgs boson decays into a bb pair, will be presented. Latest results are shown obtained using pp collision data recorded by the CMS experiment. Candidate ttH events are selected based on the number of leptons in the final state from the tt decay, and are further categorized according to the number of jets. Multivariate techniques are employed for the final event classification with an aim to discriminate between signal and background processes. Particularly challenging backgrounds arise from the tt + heavy-flavour jet production. A combined fit of multivariate discriminant distributions in all categories and tt decay channels is finally used to extract the ttH signal.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		885	2

The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The signal is characterized by a large missing transverse momentum recoiling against a bottom quark-antiquark system that has a large Lorentz boost.

728	Precision Timing with the CMS MIP Timing Detector	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is undergoing an extensive Phase II upgrade program to prepare for the challenging conditions of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In particular, a new timing layer with hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |η|=3 will measure minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with a time resolution of ~30ps. This MIP Timing Detector (MTD) will consist of a central barrel region based on LYSO:Ce crystals read out with SiPMs and two end-caps instrumented with radiation-tolerant low gain avalanche detectors. The precision time information from the MTD will reduce the effects of the high levels of pile-up expected at the HL-LHC and will bring new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. The time information assigned to each track will enable the use of 4D reconstruction algorithms and will further discriminate interaction vertices within the same bunch crossing to recover the track purity of vertices in current LHC conditions. For instance, in the analysis of di-Higgs boson production, a timing resolution of 30-40 ps is expected to improve the effective luminosity by about 25% through gains in b-tagging and isolation efficiency. We present motivations for precision timing at the HL-LHC and overview the MTD design, while also highlighting specific physics studies benefiting from the improved timing information.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		880	2

765	Search for Supersymmetry with a compressed mass spectrum in vector boson fusion topology with 1-lepton and 0-lepton final states in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV with CMS	Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the major physics goals of the Large Hadron Collider. A large number of physics analyses are being performed in CMS (and ATLAS) experiments to detect signatures of Susy particles. The search presented here aims for observing Susy particles produced in the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) topology, leading to the final state having zero or one lepton, large missing ET, and two jets with high $p^{T}$  with large rapidity separation. The analysis is performed using 35.9 fb $^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected with CMS detector during the year 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The background estimation is performed using data-driven/semi data-driven techniques and the observed dijet invariant mass, as well as lepton transverse mass spectra, are found to be consistent with the standard model predictions, but no signal observed. Hence, the upper limits are set on the cross sections for chargino $\\tilde{\\chi}^\\pm_{1}$  and neutralino $\\tilde{\\chi}^0_{2}$  production along with two associated jets, assuming the lightest scalar leptons to be lighter than the $\\tilde{\\chi}^\\pm_{1}$. For a compressed mass spectra in which mass difference between Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP)  $\\tilde{\\chi}^0_{1}$   and the mass-degenerate particles  $\\tilde{\\chi}^\\pm_{1}$  and $\\tilde{\\chi}^0_{2}$   is 30 (1) GeV, the most stringent mass upper limit to date is set for the latter two particles.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2

767	Luminosity Measurement of proton-proton collisions at the CMS experiment 	Precision luminosity calibration is critical to determine fundamental parameters of the standard model and to constrain or to discover beyond-the-standard-model phenomena at LHC.  The luminosity determination at the LHC interaction point 5 with the CMS detector, using proton-proton collisions at 13 and 5.02 TeV during Run 2 of the LHC (2015–2018), is reported.  The absolute luminosity scale is obtained using beam-separation (``van der Meer'') scans.  The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are related to the knowledge of the scale of the beam separation provided by LHC magnets and the non-factorizability between the spatial components of the proton bunch density distributions in the transverse direction. When applying the van der Meer calibration to the entire data-taking period, a substantial contribution to the total uncertainty in the integrated luminosity originates from the measurement of the linearity and stability of the CMS luminometers.  The reported integrated luminosity in 2015–2016 is among the most precise luminosity measurements at bunched-beam hadron colliders. Prospects for luminosity precision for LHC Run 3 and HL-LHC are also discussed.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2
768	Background in the CMS muon detectors: simulation and measure with pp collision data	The CMS muon system is built of different detector technologies: Drift Tube chambers (DT) and Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) serve as tracking and triggering detectors respectively in the barrel and the end-caps of the spectrometer, whereas Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) complement DT and CSC and are mostly used in the trigger. In addition, multiple layers of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) chambers are being installed in the muon system end-caps at different stages of the CMS upgrade programme. \r\nA measure of the background hit rates and currents drained by the different muon detectors during the LHC Run-2 is of prime importance for an assessment of the longevity of the chambers and their on-board electronics, which are critical for the projection of the expected performance of the system at HL-LHC. Moreover, an accurate modelling of the backgrounds using simulations is also critical. In fact, an estimation of the change in backgrounds as a consequence of the evolution of the CMS detector geometry expected for the Phase-2 upgrade, can only be performed rely on Montecarlo-based predictions.\r\nThe state of the art of the understanding of the backgrounds measured with data collected during the LHC Run-2, as well as at CERN high-intensity gamma irradiation facility, (GIF++), will be discussed. Additionally, the work made to improve the accuracy of  the background modelling in Fluka and GEANT4 simulations will be also presented.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2

In this talk, a status report on a search for a long-lived heavy neutrino decaying to three leptons is presented. This analysis focuses on the final state with one displaced lepton pair and uses the resulting invariant mass to look for an excess between 1 and 10 GeV. Data-driven methods are developed to model misidentified and non-prompt lepton backgrounds in the signal region. A sample of 41.53 $fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector in 2017 at $\\sqrt s = 13$ TeV is used.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		886	2
770	Performance of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter in LHC Run2	Many physics analyses using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC require\r\naccurate, high resolution electron and photon energy measurements. Excellent energy\r\nresolution is crucial for studies of Higgs boson decays with electromagnetic particles in\r\nthe final state, as well as searches for very high mass resonances decaying to energetic\r\nphotons or electrons. The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is presently operating\r\nat the LHC with proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy, 25 ns bunch\r\nspacing, and an unprecedented instantaneous luminosity. High pileup levels (simultaneous\r\ncollisions) and the ageing of crystals from exposure to large particle fluences necessitate\r\na retuning of the ECAL readout, trigger thresholds, and reconstruction algorithms, to\r\nmaintain the best possible performance in these increasingly challenging conditions.\r\nIn addition, the energy response of the detector must be precisely calibrated and monitored,\r\n injecting laser light to correct for crystal transparency changes due to irradiation.\r\nA dedicated calibration of each detector channel is performed with physics events\r\nexploiting electrons from W and Z boson decays, photons from pi0/eta decays, and\r\nfrom the azimuthally symmetric energy distribution of minimum bias events. This talk\r\npresents the new reconstruction algorithm and calibration strategies that have been\r\nimplemented and the excellent performance achieved by the CMS ECAL with the ultimate\r\ncalibration of Run II data, in terms of energy scale stability and energy resolution.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2
771	Search for Heavy Neutral Leptons with CMS detector	The smallness of neutrino masses provides a tantalizing allusion to physics beyond the standard model (SM). Heavy neutral leptons (HNL), such as hypothetical sterile neutrinos, accommodate a way to explain this observation, through the see-saw mechanism. If they exist, HNL could also provide answers about the dark matter nature, and baryon asymmetry of the universe. A search for the production of HNL at the LHC, originating from leptonic W boson decays through the mixing of the HNL with SM neutrinos, is presented. The search focuses on signatures with three leptons, providing a clean signal for probing the production of the HNL in a wide mass range never explored before at the LHC: down to 1 GeV, and up to 1.2 TeV. The sample of pp collisions collected by the CMS detector throughout 2016 is used, amounting to a volume of 35.9/fb. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2

The results are compared to theory predictions and re-interpreted as searches for new physics inducing deviations from the standard model predictions using an effective field theory approach. The status of the search for four top quark production, to which the LHC experiments are starting to be sensitive, and that has important BSM re-interpretations, is also reported.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2
773	The CMS Muon System: performance during the LHC Run-2	A highly performing muon system has been fundamental to achieve many of the physics results obtained by CMS during the LHC Run-2. The CMS muon spectrometer presently consists of three detector technologies covering different regions of pseudorapidity. Drift Tube chambers (DT) equip the CMS muon system barrel, whereas Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) are installed the CMS end-caps; both are used for offline tracking and provide trigger capabilities. In addition, Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) complement DT and CSC in both barrel and end-caps, and are mostly used in the trigger.\r\nFinally, at different stages of the CMS upgrade programme, the end-caps of the muon spectrometer will be equipped with multiple layers Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) chambers. A slice test consisting of 10 GEM chambers was successfully operated in 2018, in parallel to the rest of the muon system, to gain experience in view of the installation of the first complete layer of GEM, planned to happen during the second LHC long shutdown (LS2).\r\nIn this report, the performance of the different detectors comprising the CMS muon system, evaluated using data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during the LHC Run2, will be presented, together with the one of the muon trigger.\r\nThe experience from the integration and commissioning of the GEM slice tests will also be discussed, and the status and plans toward the installation of the first complete layer of GEM detector, happening over LS2, will be highlighted.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2
774	Study of the Effects of Radiation at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility on the CMS Drift Tubes Muon Detector for the HL-LHC	The CMS drift tubes (DT) muon detector, built for standing up the LHC expected integrated and instantaneous luminosities, will be used also in the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) at a 5 times larger instantaneous luminosity and, consequently, much higher levels of radiation, reaching about 10 times the LHC integrated luminosity. Initial irradiation tests of a spare DT chamber at the CERN gamma irradiation facility (GIF++), at large (~O(100)) acceleration factor, showed aging effects resulting in a degradation of the DT cell performance [1]; however, full CMS simulations have shown almost no impact in the muon reconstruction efficiency over the full barrel acceptance and for the full integrated luminosity. A second spare DT chamber was moved inside the GIF++ bunker in October 2017. The chamber was being irradiated at lower acceleration factors, and only 2 out of the 12 layers of the chamber are switched at working voltage when the radioactive source is active, being the other layers in standby. In this way the other non-aged layers are used as reference and as a precise and unbiased telescope of muon tracks for the efficiency computation of the aged layers of the chamber, when set at working voltage for measurements. An integrated dose equivalent to two times the expected integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC run has been absorbed by this second spare DT chamber and the final impact on the muon reconstruction efficiency is under study. Direct inspection of some extracted aged anode wires presented a melted resistive deposition of materials. Investigation on the outgassing of cell materials and of the gas components used at the GIF++ are underway. Strategies to mitigate the aging effects are also being developed. From the long irradiation measurements of the second spare DT chamber, the effects of radiation in the performance of the DTs expected during the HL-LHC run will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2
775	Searching for resonant HH production at CMS	New, massive bosons could be found with the LHC. Theories with warped extra dimensions and supersymmetry predict the existence of such resonances, which for some model parameters, have a significant branching fraction to two Higgs bosons. Searches for these predicted new resonances decaying to two Higgs bosons with the CMS detector are presented. Jet substructure techniques and lepton identification are used to search for massive bosons decaying to the bbbb, bbtautau, and the bblnuqq final states. The results are based on data collected during Run 2 of the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2

776	Precision Timing with the CMS MIP Timing Detector	The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is undergoing an extensive Phase II upgrade program to prepare for the challenging conditions of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In particular, a new timing layer with hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of |η|=3 will measure minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with a time resolution of ~30ps. This MIP Timing Detector (MTD) will consist of a central barrel region based on LYSO:Ce crystals read out with SiPMs and two end-caps instrumented with radiation-tolerant Low Gain Avalanche Detectors. The precision time information from the MTD will reduce the effects of the high levels of pile-up expected at the HL-LHC and will bring new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. The time information assigned to each track will enable the use of 4D reconstruction algorithms and will further discriminate interaction vertices within the same bunch crossing to recover the track purity of vertices in current LHC conditions. For instance, in the analysis of di-Higgs boson production, a timing resolution of 30-40 ps is expected to improve the effective luminosity by about 25% through gains in b-tagging and isolation efficiency. We present motivations for precision timing at the HL-LHC and overview the MTD design, while also highlighting specific physics studies benefiting from the improved timing information.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2

Vector-like quarks are postulated as a mechanism to solve the Hierarchy problem of the standard model and stabilize the Higgs mass. We search here for vector-like quarks that would decay to a standard model boson and a third generation quark. Several analyses target different decay modes and are optimized for various final state event contents, from multi-leptonic to fully hadronic. In the latter, substructure techniques are used to identify hadronically decaying top quarks and bosons, to resolve these boosted final states and increase the sensitivity of the searches. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2

781	The CMS ECAL Upgrade for High Precision Timing and Energy Measurements in HL-LHC	The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment\r\nwill be upgraded for the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). Data taking will begin in 2026 for the HL-LHC, where the number of simultaneous proton-proton collisions (pile-up) will reach 200 and a challenging increase in data rate is expected. The current lead tungstate crystals and avalanche photodiode detectors in the barrel region of the ECAL will remain, while the front-end and off-detector read-out electronics of the calorimeter will be upgraded. The new electronics will have to fulfill the requirements of the upgraded Level 1 hardware trigger system, in terms of increased latency and data bandwidth, in order to preserve detector performance despite the increased instantaneous luminosity\r\n(more than a factor 5 to the design luminosity). The upgrade will provide single crystal granularity for the hardware trigger and will enable a full read out of the detector. A crucial characteristic of the new design will be the capability to measure the timing of electrons and photons with an unprecedented precision, of the order of 30 ps for energies above 10 GeV. This excellent time resolution will improve the overall CMS physics performance under the expected pile-up conditions. For example, the precision timing information will improve the determination of the location of the production vertex for Higgs boson decays to two photons, a crucial channel for the measurement of Higgs properties. The status of the ongoing R&D activities will be presented, together with the latest beam test results with prototypes, and the development plan for the project up to installation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		878	2

All three are used for muon reconstruction and triggering. The CMS RPC system confers robustness and redundancy to the muon trigger. The RPC system provides information to all muon track finders and thus contributing to both muon trigger and reconstruction.

802	Performance of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter in LHC Run2	Many physics analyses using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC require accurate, high resolution electron and photon energy measurements. Excellent energy resolution is crucial for studies of Higgs boson decays with electromagnetic particles in the final state, as well as searches for very high mass resonances decaying to energetic photons or electrons. The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is presently operating at the LHC with proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy, 25 ns bunch spacing, and an unprecedented instantaneous luminosity. High pileup levels (simultaneous collisions) and the ageing of crystals from exposure to large particle fluences necessitate a retuning of the ECAL readout, trigger thresholds, and reconstruction algorithms, to maintain the best possible performance in these increasingly challenging conditions. In addition, the energy response of the detector must be precisely calibrated and monitored, injecting laser light to correct for crystal transparency changes due to irradiation. A dedicated calibration of each detector channel is performed with physics events exploiting electrons from W and Z boson decays, photons from pi0/eta decays, and from the azimuthally symmetric energy distribution of minimum bias events. This talk presents the new reconstruction algorithm and calibration strategies that have been implemented and the excellent performance achieved by the CMS ECAL with the ultimate calibration of Run II data, in terms of energy scale stability and energy resolution.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		896	2

Each of the 4288 DC-coupled sensors has an active area of 61×61mm2, making a total surface of around 16m2. The precision required for the calibration of the Preshower is 5%,\r\ndetermined by the fraction of energy deposited in the Preshower with respect to that in the CMS\r\nendcap crystal calorimeter. The achieved precision of channel-to-channel calibration is better than\r\n5%. The in-situ calibration is performed using isolated charged hadrons, which are close to\r\nminimum-ionizing. The current status and the calibration of the Preshower with LHC Run2 data\r\nwill be presented in this poster.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		896	2
806	The alignment of CMS Preshower detector during the LHC Run 2	The preshower detectors (ES) are silicon strip detector located between the strip tracker and the endcap crystals. Each side consists of two detection disks (front and rear) with the front (rear) plane sensitive to the X(Y) direction. As part of the CMS endcap electromagnetic calorimeter, the ES is designed to identify π0 in the endcaps by recording the position of charged particles which pass through. For minimum ionizing particles the spatial precision is ±0.055cm perpendicular to the silicon strips. The coordinate of each plane is aligned offline on the basis of the aligned tracker, the ES alignment algorithm starts by matching the expected hit point of reconstructed tracks with trajectory extrapolations to the data. A perturbative method minimizing the ^2 value in parameter space is then performed for several iterations until a stable final result is reached with respect to the tracker. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		896	2

814	The CMS ECAL Upgrade for High Precision Timing and Energy Measurements in HL-LHC	The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment will be upgraded for the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). Data taking will begin in 2026 for the HL-LHC, where the number of simultaneous proton-proton collisions (pile-up) will reach 200 and a challenging increase in data rate is expected. The current lead tungstate crystals and avalanche photodiode detectors in the barrel region of the ECAL will remain, while the front-end and off-detector read-out electronics of the calorimeter will be upgraded. The new electronics will have to fulfill the requirements of the upgraded Level 1 hardware trigger system, in terms of increased latency and data bandwidth, in order to preserve detector performance despite the increased instantaneous luminosity (more than a factor 5 to the design luminosity). The upgrade will provide single crystal granularity for the hardware trigger and will enable a full read out of the detector. A crucial characteristic of the new design will be the capability to measure the timing of electrons and photons with an unprecedented precision, of the order of 30 ps for energies above 10 GeV. This excellent time resolution will improve the overall CMS physics performance under the expected pile-up conditions. For example, the precision timing information will improve the determination of the location of the production vertex for Higgs boson decays to two photons, a crucial channel for the measurement of Higgs properties. The status of the ongoing R&D activities will be presented, together with the latest beam test results with prototypes, and the development plan for the project up to installation.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		896	2

835	First measurements with the CMS DAQ and Timing Hub prototype-1	The CMS detector will undergo a major upgrade for Phase-2 of the LHC\r\nprogram: the HiLumi LHC, starting around 2026. The Phase-2 CMS back-end electronics will be based on the ATCA standard, with node boards receiving the detector data from the front-ends for processing via custom, radiation-tolerant, optical links. An ATCA hub board, the DAQ and Timing Hub (DTH), will provide the interface between the back-end nodes and the central Trigger, Timing, and DAQ systems.

837	Realization of the BCP demonstrator back-end platform for the Phase II Upgrade of the CMS Barrel Calorimeters	For the phase II upgrade of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) to support the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC), the detector granularity will increase 25 fold and the sampling rate will increase 4 fold. To support this roughly 100 fold increase in data from the detector, the back-end electronics are being upgraded to handle this large amount of data. The upgraded back-end electronics will also support the Level-1 trigger latency increase from about 4 µs to a maximum of 12.5 µs and the trigger rate increase from 100 kHz to an average of 750 kHz. Work is underway to realize a demonstrator platform to serve as proof-of-concept for the new back-end electronics. It is called the Barrel Calorimeter Processor demonstrator (BCPd). It will be an AdvancedTCA (ATCA) blade capable of supporting 56 input and 56 output fibers, 16 Gbps each, and will serve as the nexus between the detector front-end electronics, the trigger sub-system and the DAQ sub-system. The design decisions, implementation details and status of the BCPd will be presented. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2
838	A High Throughput Production Scale Front-End Hybrid Test System for the CMS Phase-2 Tracker Upgrade	Abstract\r\nMore than twenty-five thousand hybrids will be produced for the CMS Tracker Phase Two\r\nUpgrade. The hybrids are assembled with flip-chips, passives and carbon-fibre stiffeners. They will\r\nbe glued to their module supports, together with powering and optical transmission hybrids,\r\nmaking repairs almost impossible. Due to the complexity of the hybrid circuits and the circuit\r\nassembly, production scale testing is a very important aspect. A crate-based scalable test system\r\nwas designed to enable a multiplexed test of front-end hybrids. A test card was produced for the 2S\r\nhybrids and two different hybrid test cards are under development.\r\nSummary\r\nTen different front-end hybrid variants for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Tracker Phase Two\r\nUpgrade for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) are currently under\r\ndevelopment. The upgraded Tracker is based on two main types of modules, the strip-strip (2S) and\r\nthe pixel-strip (PS). The 2S modules contain two parallel strip sensors of 10 × 10 cm2 and two\r\nfront-end hybrids connected to a service hybrid. The PS modules contain a strip sensor and a macro\r\npixelated strip sensor of 5 × 10 cm2 and two front-end hybrids connected to a power and a data\r\nservice hybrid. These modules require state of the art High Density Interconnect (HDI) front-end\r\nhybrids assembled with fine pitch flip-chip front-end ASICs, connectors and passives.\r\nThe 2S front-end hybrids interface through a fine pitch connector with a service hybrid that contains\r\nthe power conversion and a Versatile Link Plus (VTRX+) based optical link connecting to the back-\r\nend systems. The PS hybrids have an additional interface with a Macro-Pixel Sensor ASIC\r\nassembly block (MAPSA) which is located externally. The proposed system tests the hybrids\r\nthrough these interfaces.\r\nThe test infrastructure is based on a 3U 19-inch sub-rack with custom developed multiplexer\r\nbackplanes enabling the testing of twelve hybrid circuits in one crate. The backplanes are designed\r\nto multiplex high speed differential signals, USB, control lines and distribute power. Each sub-rack\r\ncan fit three backplanes interconnected in series enabling the test with twelve hybrid plug-in cards.\r\nIn this scheme, smaller systems can be assembled as well, down to four plug-in cards. The\r\nbackplane connects to the FC7 data acquisition board, which controls the selection of plug-in cards\r\nand processes the data. The FC7 is connected through IPBus to a computer running the test	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2

To maintain physics performance the Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC) muon detectors electronics will be upgraded to handle the expected higher rates.  The design of the upgraded electronics will be discussed as well as the status of the first phase of the electronics installation.  In addition, accelerated irradiation tests are being performed to study the behaviour of the CSC electronics under conditions which are an order of magnitude beyond the original design values.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2

The VFAT3 communicates with the back-end microTCA electronics through the GBTx chipset and the versatile link. Each of the 144 triple-GEM detectors has 24 VFAT3s, 3 GBTx chipsets as well as a Virtex-6 FPGA. All powered by 9 FEAST DCDC converters. \r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2
842	CATIA: APD readout ASIC for the CMS phase 2 ECAL electronics upgrade	The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) will be upgraded to maintain detector performance in the challenging environment of the High Luminosity LHC. The front-end readout electronics of the ECAL barrel will be replaced, while maintaining the existing crystals and avalanche photodiodes (APDs). Moreover, the upgrade will optimize the timing resolution of the system. The new front-end electronics consists of two cascading ASICs: a fast, dual gain trans-impedance amplifier (CATIA) and a dual ADC, designed in 130 nm and 65 nm CMOS, respectively. The latest test beam and laboratory test results of CATIA coupled with an ADC will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2
843	KARATE - a setup for high rate tests on the CMS Outer Tracker 2S module readout chain	KARATE (KArlsruher high RAte TEst) is a new test system to stress the readout chain of detector modules for the upgrade of the CMS Outer Tracker for the high-luminosity LHC. The readout chain of a 2S module consists of 16 CMS Binary Chips (CBC) connected simultaneously to two stacked silicon strip sensors. Each CBC contributes data to the level 1 trigger by detecting particles with large transverse momenta. The output is sparsified on two concentrator chips which are then connected to a Gigabit transceiver preparing the data for output through an optical module.\r\nStandard test systems such as test beams or radioactive source measurements need a track reconstruction or do have gaussian distributed hit profiles and do not reach the occupancy or trigger rates expected in the future outer tracker of CMS. KARATE uses a combination of LEDs and photodiodes to inject hit patterns with varying pulse heights, occupancies and trigger rates into the front-end of the CBC giving full control on 48 channels at 40 MHz. This gives the opportunity to directly compare injection patterns with readout patterns. The talk introduces the test system and summarizes measurements on a CBC  that is read out electrically.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2
844	40 MHz Level-1 Trigger Scouting for CMS	The CMS experiment will be upgraded for operation at the High-Luminosity LHC to maintain and extend its optimal physics performance under extreme pileup conditions. Upgrades will include an entirely new tracking system, supplemented by a track trigger processor capable of providing tracks to the Level-1 trigger, as well as a high-granularity calorimeter in the endcap region. New front-end and back-end electronics will also provide the Level-1 trigger with high-resolution information from the barrel calorimeter and the muon systems. The upgraded Level-1 processors, based on powerful FPGAs, will be able to carry out sophisticated feature searches with resolutions often similar to the offline ones, while keeping pileup effects under control.\r\nIn this paper, we discuss the feasibility of a system capturing Level-1 intermediate data at the beam-crossing rate of 40 MHz and carrying out online analyses based on these limited-resolution data.\r\nThis 40 MHz scouting system would provide fast and virtually unlimited statistics for detector diagnostics, alternative luminosity measurements and, in some cases, calibrations, and it has the potential to enable the study of otherwise inaccessible signatures, either too common to fit in the L1 accept budget, or with requirements which are orthogonal to “mainstream” physics, such as long-lived particles.\r\nTo realise such a system, data from the Level-1 trigger is preprocessed in a dedicated board equipped with a powerful FPGA before being transferred into the memory of a compute node for further processing and potential storage. We discuss the requirements and possible architecture of a Phase-2 40 MHz scouting system as well as the design of a demonstrator operated at the end of Run-2 using the Global Muon Trigger data from CMS. Plans for further demonstrators envisaged for Run 3 are also discussed.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2
845	Power hybrids for silicon modules with macro-pixel and strip sensors for the CMS Phase-2 tracker upgrade	The upgraded CMS tracker at the HL-LHC will feature new silicon modules with a macro-pixel sensor and a strip sensor on top of each other. The modules require three supply voltages (1.0V, 1.2V, 2.5V), which are provided in a two-stage DC-DC conversion powering scheme. Two DC-DC buck converters are supplied in parallel from the first powering stage. A four-layer flexible power hybrid based on the FEAST2 and bPOL2V5 DC-DC converters by CERN has been developed, using custom air-core inductors and a custom shield. The power hybrid development will be presented and the results from the characterization will be discussed. 	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2

The front-end (FE) card will provide the streaming of data from VFE to back-end electronics, which will have increased granularity (tower-level to single crystal-level). The design of the full ECAL barrel readout chain and the status of the components R&D will be presented.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2

The wirebonding of sensors and the soldering requirements for these components require an almost perfectly flat surface. A lamination process is proposed, focused on the compatibility with lead-free reflow process. The stack-up of the hybrid was optimised to balance the forces induced by the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) differences in the assembly. The proposed lamination process was applied to the 8CBC3 hybrid circuits.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2

850	Continuous Integration of FPGA Designs and Automation of the Development Environment	Abstract: The high degree of flexibility in the firmware development makes FPGA designs and the development environment vulnerable to errors. Continuous integration is a fast way to detect a majority of such errors. Additionally, simulations and hardware tests can be automated using test methodologies (e.g. unit test). Continuous integration offers the benefits of reproducible results, fast error detection, error tracing, avoiding human errors in the build process, and minimizing the manual verification of the firmware. This comes at the price of setting it up with comprehensive integration tools such as GitLab. We present such an integration flow within the CMS experiment.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2
851	First results of CIC data aggregation ASIC for the future CMS Tracker	The Concentrator Integrated Circuit (CIC) ASIC is a front-end chip for both Pixel-Strip (PS) and Strip-Strip (2S) modules of the future Phase-2 CMS Outer Tracker upgrade at  the High-Luminosity  LHC  (HL-LHC). It  collects  the  digital  data  coming  from  eight  upstream  front-end chips  (either  MPAs  or  CBCs,  depending  on  the  module  type), formats the signal in data packets containing the trigger information from eight bunch crossings  and  the  raw  data  from  events passing  the  first  trigger  level,  and  finally transmits  them  to  the  LpGBT  unit.

Each endcap will be instrumented with a two-disk system of MIP-sensitive LGAD silicon devices to be read out by ETROCs for precision timing measurements. The ETROC is designed to handle a 16×16 pixel cell matrix, each pixel cell being 1.3x1.3 mm^2 to match the LGAD sensor pixel size. The design of ETROC, with its unique challenges and how they are addressed, as well as prototype testing results, are presented.\r\n	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2

860	High-Precision Luminosity Instrumentation for the CMS Experiment at the HL-LHC	Abstract (max. 100 words)\r\nThe High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) is foreseen to increase the instantaneous luminosity by a factor of five over the present LHC nominal value. The resulting, unprecedented requirements for background monitoring and luminosity measurement create the need for new high-precision instrumentation at CMS, using radiation hard detector technologies. This contribution presents a system using the Tracker Endcap Pixel Detector (TEPX) with an additional 75 kHz of dedicated triggers for online measurement of luminosity and beam-induced background. Real-time implementations of algorithms such as pixel cluster counting on an FPGA are explored for online processing of the resulting data.	2019-05-24	physics	CMS	pending - set by default		900	2
